Handling Editor: Tobias Plieninger Abstract . Interactions between farmers and agrobiodiversity are key drivers of agroecosystems sustainability and of the resilience of such systems to perturbations, but research into the human/nature interactions have overlooked some important aspects of agrobiodiversity management. In particular, farmers' ecological knowledge of the spatial organisation of plant diversity remains an open question, although knowledge and practices have major implications for the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources. . Our study addresses this question by analysing how farmers spatially organise plant species in agroforests based on their knowledge of species interactions and interactions with the environment. The Analanjirofo region on the north- east coast of Madagascar provides an interesting context to explore this issue in clovebased agroforests, as these systems were developed by farmers as a sustainable alternative to the traditional system of shifting rice cultivation. . Using an emic approach, that is based on the farmers' perspective, and participatory mapping, we studied plant diversity and its spatial organisation in 17 clovebased agroforests and in 28 management sub- units defined by farmers in a village of Vavatenina district. The plant functions and farmers' knowledge of plant interactions with clove tree were recorded in semi- structured interviews, and the interactions were represented in a cognitive map. . Farmers manage more than 50 plant species associated with diverse functions. Analysis of participatory maps identified four main types of species association as a function of the age of the clove trees and the associated plant diversity, and different spatial organisation patterns as a function of the topography and the surrounding species. Analysis of farmers' knowledge provided valuable insights into spatial organisation practices, how farmers perceive the adaptation of plant | People and Nature
MARIEL Et AL. | INTRODUCTION
Research on local ecological knowledge, defined as ‘a cumulative body of knowledge, practice and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural transmission’ (Berkes, 1999 ) , shows that local communities have a specific and holistic understanding of their environment which contributes to their capacity to manage natural resources sustainably in an adaptive way to cope with the contingencies of environment and its spatial and temporal heterogeneity (Berkes et al., 2000; Folke, 2004 ) . Knowledge specific to plant species, their uses and their management practices have been widely investigated because they concern socio- cultural, economic and environmental issues, such as biodiversity conservation (Garibaldi & Turner, 2004; Rafidison, 2020 ) , the adaptation of agriculture to climate change (Labeyrie et al., 2021) or the food security of rural communities (Quave & Pieroni, 2015 ) . Multiscale studies have revealed the role of indigenous perceptions and beliefs in the way local communities control soil erosion and fertility, manage land use and forest regeneration in secondary fallows ( Barrera- Bassols et al., 2006; Carrière, 2002 ) . All these studies emphasise how studying local knowledge of plants species helps understand human/nature interactions, and why such knowledge play a critical role in the resilience of socio- ecological systems (Congretel & Pinton, 2020; Folke, 2004 ) .
In agroecosystems, interactions between farmers and agrobiodiversity, that is, the living organisms which contribute to agroecosystem functioning (Altieri, 2002; Jackson et al., 2007; Vandermeer & Perfecto, 1995 ) , are a key dimension of human/nature interactions. In particular, it is widely acknowledged that agroecosystems in which farmers maintain a high level of plant diversity are more resilient to environmental and socio- economic perturbations (Isbell et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2010; Lin, 2011 ) . The agroecology literature particularly emphasises the importance of farmers' knowledge on how to organise the different plant species in space depending on the different ways species adapt to biophysical conditions, and how to associate plant species to account for their positive and negative interactions (Altieri, 2002 ) . However, these aspects of farmers/agrobiodiversity interactions are still poorly understood, although an improved understanding of farmers' knowledge of agrobiodiversity and their associated management practices is crucial if agricultural development initiatives are to match local realities and meet global change challenges (Altieri & Nicholls, 2017; Labeyrie et al., 2021 ) .
Agroforestry systems are a particularly illustrative type of agrobiodiversity- based cropping system in the tropics and subtropics where local communities interact with the forest daily (Nair, 1991 ) . Agroforestry is defined as a system ‘where woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos etc.) are deliberately used on the same land management unit as agricultural crops and/or animals, either in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence’ (Zomer et al., 2014 ) . Agroforestry is recognised as an agroecological practice which, under certain conditions, ensures more sustainable agricultural production in the tropics (Mercer, 2004; Schroth & McNeely, 2011 ) . The positive effects of agroforestry on agricultural productivity ( Pumariño et al., 2015 ) , biodiversity (Bhagwat et al., 2008; Jose, 2012) and the ecosystem services such as practice provides (Jose, 2009) contribute to the well- being of rural populations (Reed et al., 2017 ) , increase resilience to climate change (Mbow et al., 2014) and help restore degraded landscapes (Hillbrand et al., 2017 ) . However, the literature on agroforestry systems rarely focusses on famers' knowledge of the ecological interactions that drive the spatial organisation of plant diversity, although this domain of local knowledge is pivotal for efficient use of biophysical resources.
A few studies have described the spatial organisation of plant species, mainly in home gardens (Abebe et al., 2013; Méndez et al., 2001) in relation to soil fertility (Junqueira, 2015) or to altitude (Sahoo & Rocky, 2015 ) , but none of these studies take farmers' knowledge into consideration as a way to understand the observed practices. Inversely, some studies on farmers' knowledge concern the interactions between plant species in relation to light and shade (Graefe et al., 2017; Smith Dumont et al., 2019 ) , interactions between plants and invertebrates that influence soil fertility (Pauli et al., 2012) or the other types of ecological interactions that affect a range of ecosystem services (Ango et al., 2014; Cerdán et al., 2012; Rigal et al., 2018 ) , but none analyse how farmers' knowledge of these ecological interactions influences the way the farmers organise the different plant species in space. The lack of studies linking farmers' species to biophysical heterogeneity of the environment and whether they can be associated with other species. . Our findings and methods pave the way for further interdisciplinary research on farmers/nature interactions to support the development of agrobiodiversitybased systems taking into account farmer and scientific knowledge and practices, especially in the tropics where the expansion of cash crops in input- intensive and mono- cropping systems has driven major disruptions to smallholder agriculture.

MARIEL Et AL. knowledge of ecological interactions with the spatial organisation of plant species is mainly due to methodological challenges, as what is required is the articulation of methods that properly collect farmers' perceptions of their environment and analyse them from a local perspective, with methods that allow the quantification and measurement patterns of organisation of different plant species.
The aim of the present study was to fill this research gap by investigating how practices used to organise plant agrobiodiversity in space relate to farmers' knowledge of interactions between plant species and with their biophysical environment, based on a case study of clove- based agroforests on the north- east coast of Madagascar ( Figure 1 ) . An emic perspective, that is, how farmers perceive their environment and their own actions related to it (Olivier de Sardan, 1998 ) , and different participatory methods and interviews were used to collect the data. First, the current diversity of plant species in agroforests and its functions were characterised along with the socio- cultural and economic drivers of this diversity. Second, the spatial organisation of plant species was analysed at two levels: species association within management sub- units and species distribution in the overall agroforest plot. Third, ecological knowledge of farmers was documented by focusing on the positive and negative interactions between plant species and clove trees, the key species in these agroforests. Finally, it was discussed how farmers' knowledge of ecological process shapes plant diversity and its spatial organisation, as a function of the biophysical heterogeneity of the environment and the other plant species. | MATERIALS AND METHODS .1 | Study area
The study was carried out in the Vavatenina district of the Analanjirofo region on the north- east coast of Madagascar (Figure 2 ) . This region experienced massive planting of cash crops, especially coffee trees and spicy plant species, widely imposed by the colonial government at the beginning of the 20th century to satisfy the needs of the French metropolis and achieve the colony's financial autonomy through a flourishing export- based agriculture (Dandoy, 1973; Isnard, 1951; Ruf & Blanc- Pamard, 1992 ) . Driven by economic factors, Analanjirofo region (literally ‘Forest of clove trees’) gradually became the main zone for plantations of clove trees Syzygium aromaticum instead of the emblematic shifting rice cultivation called tavy (Dandoy, 1973; Danthu et al., 2014 ) . The two products provided by the clove tree, cloves and essential oil have become major sources of income, and currently, many Malagasy people from the east coast base their food security strategy on both rice self- production and income from clove and other cash crops (Droy et al., 2017 ) .
The surveys were conducted in the village of Vohibary located km from the coast and 5 km from the town of Vavatenina, the district's administrative centre. The village was chosen because an in- depth agrarian diagnosis conducted in 1966 enabled a diachronic approach (Dandoy, 1973 ) . Most of the population belongs to the Betsimisaraka ethnic group. Between 1966 and 2019, the population of the village increased from 186 inhabitants (fewer than 50 households) to over 120 households, leading to the creation of a second hamlet on a hillside next to the original hamlet (Dandoy, 1973 and survey data from 2016 ) .
The climate of Analanjirofo is humid tropical with 3,600 mm of rainfall per year and an average annual temperature of 24℃ ( Jury, 2003 ) . Local people differentiate three seasons: a cool wet winter season from June to August, a hot summer season the rest of the year and a very wet period from December to March during which cyclones can occur. This coastal region is severely and regularly affected by cyclones, of which the last major ones were Honorinina (1986) Bonita (1996) and Ivan (2008 ) .
The landscape is shaped by tanety (hills) rarely exceeding 400 m in height with slopes severely gullied by rainfall. The hydrographical network is structured around the main river, the Sahameloka, which is fed by numerous streams flowing from tanety springs and irrigates the rice- growing lowlands. Soil characteristics are closely correlated with topography. Soils of the lowlands are hydromorphic and accumulate organic and inorganic sediments. The tanety are occupied FI G U R E 1 Farmers/agrobiodiversity interactions in agroforest at the interface of socio- ecological dynamics.

MARIEL Et AL. by eroded ferralitic soils with an overlying humus- bearing horizon ( Dandoy, 1973 ) . Along the topological gradient, the soil's texture, organic matter content and depth are variable and create heterogeneous environmental conditions for agriculture (Dandoy, 1973; author's own measurements made with an auger ) .
The humid tropical climate enables the cultivation of many different perennial and annual crops. The farmers cultivate paddy rice in the valley lowlands and irrigable flat lands. On tanety, they cultivate many types of crops in association, within a system they called tsabo, including trees (clove, coffee, fruit trees, various palms and others ) , lianas (vanilla and pepper) and herbaceous plants (sugarcane, cassava, maize, sweet potato and others ) . The crops are mixed in several different ways, in space and time, with variable densities and levels of stratification. The main characteristics described by farmers for a cultivated land to be a tsabo are: the presence of trees, the presence of at least two different crop species and the presence of food species. The crop species are also associated with some naturally occurring plant species, that is, non- cultivated species, including herbaceous and shrubby species, bamboo and palms that typically compose the local fallow vegetation (Rafidison et al., ). These tsabo correspond to the definition of agroforests given by Torquebiau (2000 ) , that is, agro- silvicultural productive systems that combine commercial and subsistence products. One of the few in- depth studies of Analanjirofo agroforests concerns clove- based agroforests, that is, clove- based tsabo (Arimalala et al., 2019 ) . .2 | Ethical approval
CIRAD ethics committee does not deliver ethical approval for research involving humans. To carry out the study, the Code of Ethics of the ISE (International Society of Ethnobiology) was followed. The work was conducted in collaboration with the University of Antananarivo in the frame of the ‘Forêt et Biodiversité à Madagascar’ collaboration platform (CIRAD- FOFIFA- University ) . A research permit was issued by the Secretary General of the ‘Direction Générale de l'Environnement et des Forêts’ before the study was undertaken. Before holding interviews in the village, a meeting was organised with the leader of the village and with the inhabitants to fully inform them of the purpose of the research and how it would be conducted. The methodology and the type of data collected were explained to farmers so they knew what participating in the surveys would involve. The future use of the data and the expected benefits of the study were described and discussed with the inhabitants. Written consent was provided by the village leader. The farmers participated voluntarily and were free from coercion, they had the right to withdraw at any time. Before conducting the interviews, farmers gave their prior informed consent verbally. No activities were conducted without such consent. The involvement of an interpreter, a native of the study region, helped ensure that local rules and customs were respected as well as the rights and well- being of the farmers interviewed. .3 | Data collection and analyses .3.1 | Sampling methods
The semi- directive surveys on farmers' practices and knowledge were conducted in 2019, in a sample of 17 voluntary Betsimisaraka farmers corresponding to the household head (14% of households of the village, with 1 woman and 16 men ) .

MARIEL Et AL. was linked to the division of tasks between genders, men being responsible for planting trees in the tsabo in most cases. One tsabo per household was chosen based on the following criteria: the presence of clove trees to study only clove- based tsabo, the year the farmer began to work on its tsabo to cover different tsabo age categories and the location in the landscape so that the sample of tsabo was distributed over the geographical area of the village. .3.2 | Description of the agrobiodiversity from an emic perspective
To study the plant diversity of clove- based tsabo, the farmer being interviewed was asked to list on- site all the plant species present, using their common names. This list revealed which species the farmers considered to be important for them, in relation to their functions. It included planted species and spontaneously occurring species that are tolerated, or even encouraged by the farmers. The correspondence of common names with Latin names was established with the Betsimisaraka interpreter and Malagasy specialists from the University of Antananarivo. To document the functions of each species cited, two focus groups were organised: one in each village hamlet, and each included around 10 villagers, comprised twothirds men and one- third women of different age groups. .3.3 | Analysis of practices of agrobiodiversity spatial organisation
The spatial organisation of plant species in clove- based tsabo was investigated using a participatory method to draw a map of each tsabo visited, based on the method of Méndez et al. (2001 ) . These maps were used to describe two levels of spatial organisation of the species mentioned by the farmers: their overall patterns of organisation within tsabo (i.e. distribution and location according to the slope) and their association in sub- unit defined by the farmers, called micro- zone ( Figure 3 ) . The definition of micro- zone by Méndez et al. (2001) was adapted to the local context and to farmers' perceptions, and was defined as spatial sub- units within tsabo characterised by a given assemblage of plants that differs from that of the rest of the tsabo according to the farmers. Hence, micro- zones are units of homogeneous plant agrobiodiversity management defined from the farmers' perspective. The farmers were asked whether there was a pattern in the way they associated and managed plant species in their clove- based tsabo. If so, they were asked to outline the micro- zones on the map of their tsabo. Some farmers considered that plant species management was homogeneous throughout their tsabo, in which case the tsabo corresponded to one micro- zone. In this way, 17 participatory maps and a total of 28 micro- zones (with one to three micro- zones per tsabo) were obtained. The surface area of each clove- based tsabo and its micro- zones were measured by GPS. The average size of tsabo was FI G U R E 3 Methodology of data collection and analysis for the study of the two level of agrobiodiversity spatial organization within clove- based tsabo: the overall patterns of organisation (distribution and location according to the slope) and the associations of species in micro- zone.

MARIEL Et AL. .5 ± 0.3 ha (min = 0.10 ha/max = 0.96 ha) and the sample of microzones was characterised by an average surface of 0.29 ± 0.23 ha ( min = 0.03 ha/max = 0.87 ha) and an average slope of 17.7 ± 8.9° ( min = 9°/max = 29° ) . Farmers' estimations of the abundance of vanilla and four frequent fruit trees (avocado, breadfruit, jackfruit and lychee) were recorded as the number of plants per micro- zone and, for clove trees, as well per age category. Indeed, exploratory surveys, conducted with the village chief and the elders, revealed that the age at which clove tree started producing cloves was a structuring factor for managing associated species because it does not have the same need for shade and light before and after becoming productive. According to the farmers, this is usually 10 years old, but may be younger or older depending on the growing conditions.
The participatory maps were coded to enable comparison of the spatial organisation of each species within tsabo. Two variables were selected to describe it: the position of the species according to the topographical gradient of the tsabo (i.e. top, centre and bottom; Figure 3) and the way in which each species was spatially distributed compared to the other species over the total area of tsabo (i.e. random, edge or aggregated; Figure 3 ) . For each variable, the number of times a species was associated with it was counted. A Fisher's exact test was applied to the occurrence data of each variable to test whether each species was significantly associated to a given pattern of spatial organisation.
To characterise the practices of species association with clove trees, a typology of micro- zones was established based on the presence/absence of the different plant species and the age of the clove trees. Thus, before conducting the analysis, the micro- zones were separated into two groups according to the presence/absence of productive clove trees. In each group, the differentiation of the micro- zones was based on their similarity calculated with the Jaccard index: for each pair of micro- zones, the index corresponds to the ratio between the number of times a species is present in the two micro- zones and the total number of species excluding those absent from the pair (Abebe et al.,l., 2013; Borcard et al., 2011 ) . This analysis was carried out in R (version 3.6.2) using the VEGDIST function of the vegan package (version 2.5.6 ) . According to their similarity, the micro- zones were grouped in clusters defined through a representation based on the agglomerative complete linkage principle (Borcard et al., 2011 ) . The different types of micro- zone were identified according to the first level of discrimination of the cluster. Each type of micro- zone was described by computing the mean plant species diversity and standard deviation, the species present in at least 60% of the micro- zones belonging to this type, and the mean densities of the six most frequent species associated with clove trees. .3.4 | Study of farmers' local knowledge on ecological interactions between agrobiodiversity and clove tree
Semi- structured interviews of about one hours were conducted with each farmer in the sample to document their knowledge associated with their practices resulting from the spatial organisation of plant species. The questions first centred on the plant species that had positive and negative interactions with the clove tree. The farmer was asked to explain each type of interaction described, particularly the ecological process that made an interaction positive or negative. A discussion of the participatory map enabled to understand the spatial distribution of all plants represented, and to deepen the structuring role of other frequent species.
The information gathered through the 17 semi- structured interviews was summarised and transcribed in the form of an interactions map. This work is based on the mental model framework used to represent the mental construction of actors and their perception of their environment and general phenomena (Özesmi & Özesmi, 2004 ) . In our case, the map was intended to bring out farmers' perceptions of the ecological processes that occur in interactions between the clove tree and other species in tsabo. The map was built to represent the nature of the ecological process involved in the interaction (competition and growth, soil fertilisation, uptake of water from the soil, application of water to the plant or to the soil, etc.) and the physical element involved (soil, water and light ) . The resulting map revealed the total number of interactions described by the farmers (i.e. the association of one species with an ecological process) and the number of farmers (out of the 17) who mentioned that interaction. | RESULTS .1 | Emic description of tsabo plant agrobiodiversity
The plant diversity cited by the farmers over the 17 clove- based tsabo sampled consisted of 51 species, including 36 trees, seven herbaceous plants, two bamboos, four palms and two lianas ( Appendix 1 ) . Plant species were grouped in 28 families, the most common being Myrtaceae represented by five species, followed by Fabaceae, Moraceae and Rutaceae, each represented by four species. The plant diversity measured and based on farmers' reports varied between the 17 tsabo in the sample. On average, the farmers listed 15 species (±4; range 8– 22 ) . Only 22% of the 51 species cited were present in at least half of the tsabo. The most frequent fruit species were jackfruit Artocarpus heterophyllus and lychee Litchi chinensis, followed by breadfruit Artocarpus altilis and banana (Musa sp. ) . Coffee Coffea canephora and vanilla Vanilla planifolia were the two cash crops also present in about half of the 17 clove- based tsabo studied. A total of 54% of the species were cited by fewer than eight farmers, and among these, 28% were cited by only one farmer each.
The villagers grouped plant species into nine function categories (Appendix 2 ) . The azahoam bola category (literally ‘gives money’) corresponded to cash crops. The bômafana category (literally: ‘what is heated up the day before and eaten the next morning’) grouped species whose carbohydrate- rich fruits and tubers are consumed for breakfast or in the afternoon (breadfruit; yam, Dioscorea spp.; cassava, Manihot esculenta ) . The dessert category contained a wide range of fruit species consumed as snacks during the day and not considered | 7

MARIEL Et AL. to be nutritional foods by the farmers (dessert voankazo for fruit trees and dessert for non- woody species ) . Two species were used to make vegetable oil (menaka ) : oil palm Elaeis guineensis for cooking and coconut palm Cocos nucifera for haircare. The rô- mazava category (literally ‘clear broth’) corresponded to plants used to prepare broths to accompany rice. Two categories were defined for species that supply wood: kitay for firewood species (distilling and cooking) and kakazo trano (literally ‘house tree’) for woody species used for carpentry ( poles, beams, fencing, roofs and boards) but sometimes also used as firewood. Some farmers assigned lychee and coffee to different uses, as dessert voankazo or azahoam bola. Lastly, some species had a use that did not correspond to a named category. This was the case for shade trees (Albizia stipulata, A. lebbeck ) , vanilla support trees (Pachira aquatica, Ficus sp., Gliricidia sepium) and Raphia farinifera, whose leaves were used to make string and woven stool seats. .2 | Practices of plant agrobiodiversity spatial organisation in tsabo
The results of the Fisher's exact test indicated significant dependence between the plant species and the two variables describing the spatial organisation: the location of species according to the topography of the tsabo (p value < 0.05) and the spatial distribution of species within (p value < 0.0005 ) . Analysis of the spatial distribution variable ( aggregated, edge and random) showed that the farmers tended to distribute the species randomly across the tsabo, particularly clove and silky oak, which were planted in the entire tsabo (Figure 4a ) . Only a few species, such as large bamboo and lychee, were usually planted on the border of tsabo. Aggregated distribution appeared to apply in particular to vanilla, banana, breadfruit and coffee (38% ≤ occurrence ≤ 60% ) . Concerning the spatial location variable, the farmers tended to prefer planting vanilla and coffee at the bottom of the tsabo, and to conserve large bamboo (‘be’ species) at the same location: more than 50% of individuals of each of these species were growing at the bottom of the tsabo (Figure 4b ) . The species that appeared to be the least demanding in terms of location were clove, lychee and Gliricidia sepium, as they were planted equally frequently in all three positions. The farmers seemed to let silky oak Grevillea banksii and traveller's palm Ravenala madagascariensis grow at the top of the tsabo (occurrence ≥ 50% ) : since, when these plants appeared spontaneously in other locations, the farmers removed them. .3 | Species association patterns within tsabo

MARIEL Et AL.
Group A (tsabo with mixed age clove trees) comprised 13 microzones with clove trees that were over 10 years old and in which 82% of the previously cited species occurred. Group B (tsabo with only young clove trees) included 15 micro- zones with no productive clove trees and in which 74% of the previously cited species occurred. In each group, the discrimination of the micro- zones at the first clustering level of the dendrograms led to the identification of two types of micro- zone per group: mixed age clove 1 and 2 (Ma1, Ma2 ) , young clove 1 and 2 (Y1, Y2) (Figure 5 ) .
In the type mixed age clove 1 (Ma1 ) , 60% of the species cited by the farmers were represented. These six micro- zones contained high species diversity (mean: 13 ± 2, Figure 5 ) . They were characterised by association of mature clove trees, young clove trees and various fruit species. The most frequent fruit species were banana, jackfruit, lychee, breadfruit, avocado and coffee, which were present in at least four out of the six micro- zones. The density of young clove trees was high (161 ± 177 trees/ha, Figure 6) compared to that of the mature clove trees (84 ± 65 trees/ha ) . This type was also characterised by a high density of lychee (17 ± 18 trees/ha) and included three micro- zones rich in vanilla with the highest and most variable density ( 132 ± 183 plants/ha ) , compared to the other types (Ma2 = 56 ± 139, Y1 = 108 ± 215, Y2 = 4 ± 12 plants/ha ) . The type mixed age clove 2 was less diversified than Ma1. It accounted for 54% of the previously cited species and the seven micro- zones it included had a mean species richness of 10 ± 3, with only mature clove trees present throughout this type of micro- zone (frequency = 100% ) . The other three species present in at least 60% of the micro- zones were traveller's palm, jackfruit and lychee. Unlike Ma1, type Ma2 was characterised by a high density of clove trees over 10 years old (194 ± 93 trees/ha) and a low density of clove trees under 10 years old (39 ± 50 trees/ha ) .
The two young clove types corresponded to the micro- zones with no clove trees over 10 years old. They were clearly distinguishable by their species composition: type Y1 micro- zones included 72% of all previously cited species, whereas those ascribed to type Y2 only included 38%. Type Y1 had high species richness (mean 12 ± 3 species) and stood out due to the presence of several fruit species: banana, lychee and coffee (present in seven micro- zones ) , along with jackfruit, breadfruit and avocado (present in six micro- zones ) . However, species composition was highly variable among type Y1, with few species shared between them. The densities calculated for young clove trees (230 ± 199 trees/ha, Figure 6 ) , lychee (18 ± 24 trees/ha) and avocado (29 ± 42 trees/ha) were higher than in the other three types but also much more variable, as shown by the standard deviations. Half the micro- zones contained vanilla, whose density sometimes reached 632 plants/ha. Type Y1 therefore also displayed high variability in terms of structure linked to variations in the density of the species present. Unlike type Y1, the seven type Y2 micro- zones clearly had a lower mean species richness, with 5 ± 2 species, and only had clove trees under 10 years old in common. This type was therefore less diversified but had the highest density of young clove trees (268 ± 211 trees/ha ) . The other main species in this type was jackfruit, which occurred at high density (58 ± 108 trees/ha ) . .4 | Farmers' knowledge of ecological interactions
The farmers described a total of 31 interactions involving clove and another plant species (Figure 7 ) : 21 with positive effects and 10 with negative effects. They referred to a total of 19 species among which eucalyptus was cited in different negative interactions by six farmers. The farmers explained that this was because eucalyptus roots affected soil water, soil fertility and plant growth. Lychee was also cited as a negative species for clove tree mainly because its canopy provided too much shade. According to the farmers, silky oak, FI G U R E 5 Typology of micro- zones and its characteristics related to the agrobiodiversity present in micro- zones.

MARIEL Et AL. cited by 11, interacted positively with clove trees in several ways, by improving the soil and its fertility, and by providing productive clove trees with water and adequate shade. The interaction map underlined the central place of the soil in the ecological processes described by the farmers: it was cited in 17 positive interactions and five negative ones. The clove tree's need for light also seemed to be an important factor, as 11 farmers pointed to the role of seven species in providing suitable shade.
During the interviews, the farmers described some other types of interactions, without specifying either the associated species or the ecological process involved. For instance, some farmers explained that all the species that were not taller than clove trees had positive effects on it (banana, coffee, silky oak, avocado and jackfruit ) . Conversely, all tall trees were considered to have negative effects on productive clove trees, as they cast too much shade on them. | DISCUSSION
Our study of clove- based tsabo in the Vavatenina area in Madagascar confirmed that clove trees are associated with a range of perennial and herbaceous plant species, and in agroforests that present a higher level of plant diversity than the level measured in agroforests in nearby areas (Arimalala et al., 2019 ) . However, comparison of the two studies was limited by differences in the methods used (lists vs. floristic species inventory ) . Our findings are in agreement with those of other studies showing that plant diversity in agroforests is linked to several functions (food, income, timber, stake, fertility, shade tree ) , and is chosen by farmers based on the contributions of plants species to agroecosystem functioning (e.g. shade, fertility, stake) and to fulfil household needs (Díaz et al., 2018; Reed et al., 2017 ) . The discussion hereafter provides insights into how farm strategies influence the plant diversity that farmers cultivated and managed in their tsabo by taking socio- economic and environmental factors ( e.g. cyclone, fluctuating sales price) into account. Our analysis of plant management practices revealed the existence of species associations and spatial organisation practices shared by most farmers. These practices can be partially explained by farmers' ecological knowledge, in line with other studies showing the close links between farmers' knowledge, their perception of the environment and their farming practices (Cerdán et al., 2012; Vuillot et al., 2016 ) . .1 | Plant agrobiodiversity in tsabo is driven by the functions of the species as perceived by Betsimisaraka people and by farm strategies
This section describes and discusses the drivers of the current plant agrobiodiversity associated with clove tree in tsabo. First, plant diversity appears to be largely driven by the diversity of functions associated with the different plant species, allowing farmers to fulfil a range of needs, for instance, food production for human or animal FI G U R E 6 Average density for each micro- zone's type of productive and young clove tree, vanilla and four fruit tree species frequently occur in tsabo (avocado, breadfruit, jackfruit and lychee ) .

MARIEL Et AL. self- consumption, income generation, and the production of building material and firewood. Thus, the differences in the frequency of occurrence of the plant in tsabo are partly linked to their functions for the households, in particular, the diversity of fruit species. For instance, in addition to being highly appreciated as a fruit to eat, lychees have gained economic value since the improvement and the facilitation of lychee exports from Madagascar to Europe beginning in 1987 (Jahiel et al., 2014 ) . The presence of banana, breadfruit and jackfruit in most clove- based tsabo is linked to their importance for human consumption, especially in the lean season, and as animal feed to cope with the lack of pastureland (pers. obs. ) . The pasture available for zebus is decreasing as farmers build gates around their tsabo to prevent other zebus from entering. Banana also has nonfood uses: its leaves are used as decoration during traditional ceremonies and as plates for meals, and the central stem cut into pieces is used to add organic matter to the soil. Generally, these fruits are FI G U R E 7 Cognitive map representing farmers' knowledge (17 farmers) concerning the positive and negative interactions of clove tree with other tsabo plant species, and the ecological processes involved in these interations | 11

MARIEL Et AL. mainly produced for self- consumption due to the lack of access to profitable markets, the lack of collectors and motorised public transport in the village studied here, which require produce to be transported on foot over great distances. Even if coffee has largely lost its commercial value since the economic crisis in the 1970s, thereby affecting Malagasy coffee producers (Ruf & Blanc- Pamard, 1992 ) , coffee trees were still observed in clove- based tsabo and harvests were sufficient to satisfy the low local consumption of Betsimisaraka people from villages and towns. Second, another driver is related to farm strategies, designed around the household's activities (agricultural or off- farm activities) and its assets and means of production ( Bannister & Nair, 2003 ) , and the infrastructure available to access markets (Bellow et al., 2008; Scales & Marsden, 2008 ) . In our case, it appears that the plant agrobiodiversity in clove- based tsabo differs among farmers depending on the extent of paddy rice they cultivate, and the strategy they adopt to achieve household food selfsufficiency (pers. obs. ) . In fact, annual rice production cannot satisfy a household's needs if the rice fields are not large enough. In this case, farmers rely on the crops they grow in their tsabo to earn the cash they need to buy rice, and tend to increase the plantation of cash crops, and especially in agroforestry systems (Andriatsitohaina et al., 2020 ) . Lastly, an important driver of tsabo plant agrobiodiversity is risk management. Cultivating a range of species with similar functions is a strategy to maintain these functions in the face of perturbations of different kinds, particularly climatic (cyclones) and economic (market price variations) disturbances. Thus, the presence and the abundance of a particular species in tsabo is largely driven by its sensitivity to different kinds of risk. One example of how the perception of risks affects farmers' agrobiodiversity choices was provided by vanilla, which was not planted by all the farmers despite its economic boom in 2016 (Llopis et al., 2019 ) , or only in small proportions compared to other cash crops. The farmers' motivation to cultivate vanilla has been affected by the highly fluctuating sales price of vanilla (Llopis et al., 2019 ) , problems of theft (Neimark et al., 2019) and the fear of not selling their production in a good formal market (Hänke et al., 2018 ) . Another risk is linked to cyclones, which has led farmers to reduce the number of tall trees planted in association with clove trees, they may fall onto the clove trees and destroy the plantation.
Studying plant agrobiodiversity based on interviews with the farmers allowed us to identify the species that are important to the farmers, but the real plant richness of tsabo was probably underestimated, and this method of collecting data may have introduced some bias concerning the relative importance of the different species. For instance, the large number of tree species cited could be linked to the particular importance of trees for Malagasy people (Bing, 2018; Rafidison et al., 2020) or, alternatively, could be explained by the attentional mechanism of visual saliency, which makes some items stand out from their neighbours and immediately attract our attention. Conversely, the frequency of annual species, such as cassava or yam, was probably under- estimated, as these species were often observed during our visits to the tsabo, but were rarely mentioned by the farmers. One explanation for the apparent limited importance given to tuber species is their status as ‘food- shortage’ crops. Indeed, cassava and yam are usually consumed if rice was lacking in the lean period and are negatively associated with shortage, and the shame of not having enough rice to feed the family (pers. obs. ) . To check the real plant biodiversity in tsabo, flora inventories would enable more in- depth analysis and comparisons with other sites. The farmers interviewed did not mention the influence of development projects or government policies on how they managed plant agrobiodiversity. This may be due to the geographical isolation of the village we surveyed. However, several studies have shown that Malagasy government decisions drive farmers' strategies, for example, through the establishment of protected areas (Andriatsitohaina et al., 2020; Gardner et al., 2018 ) . .2 | Farmers' knowledge of plant interactions drives species association practices
Analysis of the micro- zones revealed the existence of different types of species associations in clove- based tsabo that are explained by the map of interactions highlighting the ecological and agronomic intertwined functions of plant species. The farmers therefore incorporate their perceptions of the ecological interactions between species in their association practices. For instance, farmers reported that silky oak and jackfruit had two positive effects on mature clove trees by providing suitable shade and maintaining a degree of moisture in the soil thanks to the degradation of their fallen leaves, which improved soil fertility. Farmers' perception of such interactions explained the presence of jackfruit with clove in the two mixed clove age types and one of the two types of micro- zones containing young clove trees. Discussions with the farmers highlighted the positive impact of banana, Guiana chestnut Pachira aquatica and Gliricidia sepium on vanilla, by providing a favourable microclimate. This knowledge justified the presence of these three species in the micro- zones with a high density of vanilla.
Some species were found to co- occur in the same micro- zones, although some farmers reported that their association had a negative effect on one or both species. This was the case of coffee and clove, frequently seen associated with vanilla in two types of microzones (mixed age clove 1 and young clove 1 ) , whereas some farmers reported that these two trees have negative effects on vanilla. Likewise, lychee trees were associated with clove trees in all four types of micro- zone, despite the farmers' perception that they cast too much shade. Traveller's palm was present in two types of microzones (mixed age clove 2 and young clove 2 ) , although the farmers considered it has a negative effect on clove through its effect on the soil. Some authors also show that traveller's palm is a plant often linked to a degraded soil (Hladik et al., 2000) that suggests the palm would not be the cause of a degraded soil, but a consequence.
These examples of contradictions between knowledge and practices reveal how farmers manage trade- offs between the different ecological services and disservices provided by the species ( Ango et al., 2014; Vaast & Somarriba, 2014 ) . Depending on their | People and Nature
MARIEL Et AL. preferences and their perceptions of interactions between species, farmers either choose to favour a given species over others or look for synergies (Carrière, 2002 ) . This is often the case when the perceived interaction is that a given plant reduces the yield of another ( especially a cash crop species ) , but otherwise provides numerous ecological services to the system (Ango et al., 2014 ) . In a trade- off situation, farmers may choose not to plant a species because of its negative effects, but they may also decide to keep it and to change their practices to minimise its negative effects. One way of doing this is to modify the spatial organisation of the species within the system, as discussed later in this section.
Our study clearly identified the species that are most important to the farmers, along with the cropping practices and the knowledge associated with them. Yet, many species were only cited a few times and some knowledge was held only by one or a few farmers. Based on the hypothesis that such ecological knowledge can better explain contrasting and singular practices (Abric, 2011; Michel- Guillou & Moser, 2006 ) , one possible solution would be to create mental maps at the individual scale that could be used to more finely represent farmers' knowledge and perceptions (Isaac et al., 2009; Vuillot et al., 2016 ) , and in this way, to better understand the role of minor species, explain rare practices and also to focus more on the differences between farmers rather than on their similarities. .3 | Farmers' perceptions of the environment drive spatial organisation practices of agrobiodiversity
The topographical gradient at the scale of the tsabo and its consequences for the environmental characteristics (soil, moisture, exposure to sunlight and to cyclones) appear to structure the spatial organisation of plant agrobiodiversity, making it possible to provide growing conditions adapted to the needs of each plant species. The map of positive and negative interactions of clove trees reveals the attention paid by farmers to species water, fertility and light requirements, three factors which shape the biophysical heterogeneity of the environment. Analysis of the participatory tsabo maps highlighted common practices that can be explained by farmers' perception of the soil fertility, as reported in many ethno- pedological studies (Barrera- Bassols & Zinck, 2003) and through the catena concept developed by Milne and his colleagues in the 1930s to formalise farmers' perceptions of the spatial distribution of soils along a topographical gradient (Borden et al., 2020; Milne, 1947 ) . Therefore, it appears that if the farmers favour the bottom of their tsabo to plant species such as vanilla or banana, it is because they know these species need fertile soil and moderate sunlight (‘Vanilla is grown at the bottom of the tsabo where it is cool and humid (mangatsiatsiaka) as the sun heats that part less’ ) . Bamboo is also left at the bottom because ‘when it rains it retains water’, thereby playing the role of a physical barrier against erosion. These biophysical considerations were also described in other studies dealing with the factors of land use change and management in the north of Madagascar ( Andriatsitohaina et al., 2020; Ramboatiana et al., 2018 ) . Our results provide an overview of the different environmental factors considered by farmers in their agrobiodiversity management practices. Soil appears to be a major factor, in the sense that farmers decide on the spatial location of a species according to its adaptability to soils of variable fertility. This suggests that managing plant species in space is a way for farmers to cope with soil heterogeneity, thereby confirming previous qualitative observations (Altieri, 2002 ) . However, these exploratory results point to the need for a better understanding of farmers' knowledge of cultivated soils and their heterogeneity, and of relations between soil and plant agrobiodiversity (Niemeijer & Mazzucato, 2003 ) .
The spatial organisation of species was also a response to tradeoffs between ecological services and disservices that determine the way farmers distributed species relative to the location of the other species. This was notably the case for three useful species planted on the boundaries of tsabo: lychee, because its canopy casts too much shade over clove trees, eucalyptus (firewood, timber) because its ‘hard roots’ (matoy vahatra) take up water from the soil, competing with clove and vanilla, and the two bamboo species (land- use markers and construction materials) because their roots propagate quickly and begin competing with other species (‘bamboo spreads quickly and can kill clove trees’ ) . While farmers emphasised the ability of eucalyptus roots to ‘dry out’ the soil (Amazonas et al., 2018 ) , its allelopathic effect on other species has also been proven (Chu et al., 2014 ) , but not perceived by the farmers interviewed. | CONCLUSION
By providing a better understanding of how farmers make and adapt their choice of plant species and the spatial organisation of the species by accounting for socio- economic and biophysical factors, our study contributes to fill the research gap on these understudied aspects of farmers/agrobiodiversity interactions. Such understanding is key to support the design of biodiversity- based solutions for enhancing the resilience of agroecosystems. In particular, our results emphasise the holistic perceptions that farmers have of the local environment, and the complexity of their decision- making, based on trade- off between the different functions of plant species and their effects on the environment. Our study hence highlights the importance of paying particular attention to farmers' knowledge and decision- making process concerning plant species choice and spatial organisation in development initiatives aiming at supporting agroforestry, as our results indicate that there is no ‘one size fits all’ agroforestry solution. For that, our findings and methods based on an emic and participatory approach pave the way for further interdisciplinary research on farmers/agrobiodiversity interactions, interweaving farmers' and researchers' knowledge through a ‘multiple evidence base approach’ (Tengö et al., 2014 ) .

MARIEL Et AL. particular, agroforestry represents a way to restore land that was formerly forested, to limit erosion, regulate hydrological flows and restore soil fertility (Martin et al., 2020 ) . The complex mosaic of land use observed in our study area results from farmers' decisions and constraints, in many places and over many years. In that sense, sustainable restoration of the landscape through agroforestry is not relevant without the close involvement of farmers and the full recognition and consideration for their knowledge.
In this context of ongoing agroforestry transition, initiated and driven by local Betsimisaraka people, our study highlights the high adaptability of farmers and the way they use opportunities to adapt to changes, which are the result of the interweaving of multiple knowledge and practices they observed and tested in situ (Berkes, 1999 ) . Our results call for exploring the origin of— and changes in— local knowledge and factors that influence, weaken and/ or enrich them, which would improve our understanding of the practices observed at a given moment in time and discuss their trends.

Abstract . Palaeontological animal bone deposits are rarely investigated through research partnerships where the local First Nations communities have a defining hand in both the research questions asked and the research processes. Here we report research undertaken through such a partnership approach at the iconic archaeological site of Cloggs Cave (GunaiKurnai Country, East Gippsland ) , in the southern foothills of SE Australia's Great Dividing Range. . A new excavation was combined with detailed chronometric dating, highresolution 3D mapping and geomorphological studies. This allowed interpretation of a sequence of stratigraphic layers spanning from a lowermost excavated mixed layer dated to between 25,640 and 48,470 cal BP, to a dense set of uppermost, ash layers dated to between 1460 and 3360 cal BP. This long and welldated chronostratigraphic sequence enabled temporal trends in the abundant small mammal remains to be examined. . The fossil assemblage consists of at least 31 taxa of mammals which change in proportions through time. Despite clear evidence that the Old Ancestors repeatedly carried vegetation into the cave to fuel cool fires (no visible vegetation grows in Cloggs Cave ) , we observed little to no evidence of cooking fires or calcined bone, suggesting that people had little involvement with the accumulation of the faunal remains. Small mammal bones were most likely deposited in the cave by large disc- faced owls, Tyto novaehollandae (Masked Owl) or Tyto tenebricosa (Sooty Owl ) . , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10410 by University of Adelaide Alumni, Wiley Online Library on [13/11/2022 ] .

MCDOWELL et al. | INTRODUCTION
Palaeontological and archaeological research have many levels of significance, that is, findings that are considered worthy of attention. But what is deemed significant, and by whom?
To most palaeontologists, significance lies in the temporal, taxonomic, taphonomic and palaeobiogeographic occurrence of an animal's remains. For archaeologists, significance is usually found also in the cultural practices of the past, such as how and why plant and animal species were obtained; the exploitation of habitats for subsistence resources; and the stories passed down through the ages that embody the cultural significance of sites and landscapes. Both disciplines aim to garner information from the objects they discover to construct evidence- based narratives that attempt to interpret past events, spatial patterns and temporal trends. Many important sites, such as Cloggs Cave in GunaiKurnai Aboriginal Country, East Gippsland (SE Australia) (Figure 1 ) , are comprised not just of palaeontological and archaeological deposits, but more importantly consist of the homelands of First Nations peoples whose ancestors, and current generations, have long called home, and for whom buried deposits are living ancestral presences (for Australian Aboriginal notions of ‘Country’, see below ) . The findings and significance of such deposits cannot thus simply be treated as ‘natural’ assemblages, but rather as part of the cultural landscape of First Nations Traditional Owners. For many Traditional Owner groups, for such assemblages to be studied, research partnerships are required, for example between palaeontologists, archaeologists and geomorphologists and the community members whose Country the sites lie in and whose past and present connect them to it.
Palaeontological and archaeological research provide fundamental tools to reveal details about past, present and future landscapes. So, too, does community connections to Country, for knowledge held by First Nations Traditional Owners include rights to ancestral places, traditions, stories and memories about those places, all signalling fundamental relations between people and with place. Consequently, it seems self- evident that, where respectful partnerships that include ethical rights to ancestral lands and waters have been established, and where such research has been deemed socially and culturally acceptable by First Nations peoples as Traditional Owners of sites and landscapes, palaeontologists, archaeologists and Traditional Owners collaborate to maximise the depth of new knowledge and understanding that can be achieved when working together on Country. An important dimension of such equitable and respectful relations is: who sets the agenda such as the research questions, and under what terms does the research take place? In other words, who determines what is significant, at the start of a project (e.g. which site or landscape will be investigated and why; where will funding be applied for and under what terms? ) , during a project (e.g. who will work on a project? Where will the laboratories be based? What analyses will be done? And which samples will be sent off, sometimes for destructive analyses?) and at the ‘end’ of a project (e.g. which results will be presented and to whom, in what order and under whose authorship? ) . While these varied dimensions stretch across a project's duration, all aspects should, as far as possible, be discussed collaboratively before the project begins, as a prelude or segue to its viability.
It is worth noting that what is significant to palaeontologists and archaeologists may or may not be of interest to Traditional Owners, and vice versa. Such differences may relate to geographical scale ( e.g. local, regional, national vs. global issues ) ; social connections ( e.g. socially distant vs. descendant communities ) ; temporal scale ( specific events and activities vs. time- averaged temporal trends ) ; temporal focus (the deep past vs. recent times ) ; topic and its approach (e.g. continuity and change; past social circumstances vs. adaptationist explanatory frameworks ) . For Traditional Owners generally, ancestral connections between people and place, considered in culturally appropriate cosmological and ethical contexts, as well as technical excellence, are key dimensions of good, acceptable research. Sometimes, First Nations peoples will have no problem with a research agenda that is not of immediate concern to community members. At other times they may. Listening to such concerns and appropriately planning projects in good partnerships requires a willingness to enter into project discussions from the start, to hear, and to engage in ongoing communication that involves local community members and outside researchers meeting, visiting and experiencing places together. For Traditional Owners, spending time on Country . Despite being well dated and largely undisturbed, the Cloggs Cave assemblage does not appear to track known Late Quaternary environmental change. Instead, the complex geomorphology of the area fostered a vegetation mosaic that supported mammals with divergent habitat preferences. The faunal deposit suggests a local ancestral landscape characterised by a resilient mosaic of habitats that persisted over thousands of years, signalling that the Old Ancestors burned landscape fires to encourage and manage patches of different vegetation types and ages within and through periods of climate change.

MCDOWELL et al. is fundamental to valuing species and ecosystems. The stories and memories from visiting different parts of the landscape create a ‘natural history’ knowledge and literacy that supplements the scientific evidence, and that is founded on the cultural significance of taxa, places and human relations with each. Research through representative community organisations facilitates such processes, and the navigation of potential difficulties towards their solution. Such a way of scientific enquiry has recently been nationally framed as a CARE ( Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) approach. .1 | Cloggs Cave, GunaiKurnai Country, East Gippsland (SE Australia)
An important question, or perspective, that is rarely (if ever) addressed in Australian palaeontology and archaeology concerns how animal bone deposits are deemed ‘natural’ versus ‘cultural’ in local Aboriginal world views (for international anthropological literature on this topic, see e.g. Bradley, 2010; David, Fresløv, Mullett, Delannoy, et al., 2021; Descola, 2013; Morphy, 1989; Taylor, 1996 ) . For GunaiKurnai First Nations peoples, the notion of Country refers not just to places with archaeological deposits, but rather to the entire ancestral landscape. Country was and continues to be shaped by the Old People, or Old Ancestors, as the ancestors are respectfully referred to by community members, who gave their descendants their languages, territories, dances, songs, kinship systems, rituals and Law. Country was frequented by the Old Ancestors who may have passed away but whose spirits remain. What is ‘natural’ in an ancestral landscape that has been formed and is populated by the Old People (and where the Old People may be deceased but have not passed away ) ? How, then, do and should palaeontologists, archaeologists and geomorphologists, for example, treat deposits of what is usually for them regarded as ‘naturally’ deposited animal bones? And what about individual sites, like Cloggs Cave, where archaeological signs of human presence are accompanied by ‘naturally’ accumulated animal bone deposits?
Cloggs Cave, a small limestone cave perched 72.3 m above sea level in the foothills of the Australian Alps, in the Middle Devonian- aged Buchan Group limestone within GunaiKurnai Aboriginal Country (David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al., 2021; Delannoy et al., 2020; VandenBerg et al., 1996 ) , has been identified as an archaeologically significant site since the early 1970s (Figure 2 ) . As part of her pioneering PhD research, Josephine Flood excavated a 2.4 m- deep pit in, and shallower pits outside, the cave's accumulated sediments, FI G U R E 1 Study region, showing the location of Cloggs Cave and other excavated archaeological sites in GunaiKurnai Country.

MCDOWELL et al. to investigate the subsistence economy and material culture of the Old Ancestors. Flood discovered a small number of culturally manufactured artefacts inside the cave, a rich small vertebrate faunal assemblage, complex stratigraphy (see Delannoy et al., 2020 ) , and in the deepest layers, bones and teeth of the extinct giant short- faced kangaroo, Sthenurus orientalis (now synonymous with Simosthenurus occidentalis ) , and Macropus giganteus titan (a species related to the extant Grey Kangaroo) (Flood, 1973, 1980; Hope, 1973; see also David, Arnold, et al., 2021 ) . Given Flood's research focus on Aboriginal patterns of occupation and subsistence, and a paucity or absence of animal food refuse in the deposit, little effort was invested in analysing and interpreting the animal bone assemblage beyond an unpublished analysis conducted by Hope (Appendix XIV in Flood, 1973 ) .
In 2019– 2020, the GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, representing the Aboriginal Traditional Owners of Cloggs Cave and its landscape, requested new archaeological excavations to resolve outstanding questions about the antiquity of the Cloggs Cave assemblage from the original excavations and to provide a better understanding of the cave and its (cultural) sequence, in particular so that questions and research processes of significance to the community could be addressed. Using culturally and scientifically appropriate contemporary practices, the new excavations and FI G U R E 2 Cloggs Cave.

MCDOWELL et al. mapping yielded a small number of stone artefacts including flaked tools, a grindstone used to process both Bogong moths and minerals, stone arrangements employed in rituals and an accessible rock ceiling in a shallow alcove where stalactites had been broken and apparently crushed by people (David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al., 2021; Delannoy et al., 2020; Stephenson et al., 2020 ) . Consistent with Hope's earlier but unpublished findings, abundant small vertebrate remains were again found, providing an excellent opportunity to learn more about the palaeontological, archaeological and GunaiKurnai cultural significance of the cave and what it meant to the Old Ancestors. Here we present the results of the faunal analyses to systematically ask: ( 1) is there any archaeological evidence of people having brought or processed animals in the cave; (2) what can the recently excavated animal bones from Cloggs Cave tell us about local and regional faunal distributions in the past; and (3) what can the bone deposit tell us about the site and its landscape over time? | METHODS .1 | Ethics
As this research has been conducted with the full support of the GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation and does not require animal experimentation, Ethics approval were not required. .2 | Excavation and stratigraphy
Flood's original excavations inside the cave revealed a complex stratigraphy containing a very rich small vertebrate faunal assemblage consisting largely of owl roost remains and occasional stone artefacts (for methods and results, see Flood, 1973, 1974, 1980; Hope, 1973 ) . The excavation and dating methods used in our new study are described in David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al. (2021 ) , David, Arnold, et al. (2021) and Stephenson et al. (2020 ) . The stratigraphy and geomorphology of the cave are described in Delannoy et al. (2020) and David, Arnold, et al. (2021 ) , and artefacts and archaeological sequences are described in David, Fresløv, Mullett, Delannoy, et al. (2021 ) , David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al. (2021 ) , Mialanes et al. (in press) and Stephenson et al. (2020 ) . The key points of methodology for this paper are that in 2019– 2020, three 50 × 50 cm squares were excavated against the cleaned walls of the unfilled (exposed) – 1972 pit. Contiguous Squares P34– P35 were dug against the southeast wall of the pit, Square R31 against the northeast wall. Excavations proceeded in typically <2 cm- thick ‘spits’ or excavation units (XUs) following the stratigraphy. All excavated sediments were bagged without sieving and taken to the Monash University archaeology laboratories, where they were wet- sieved in 2 mm mesh, air- dried, and from which all ≥2 mm- long artefacts, bone and other nonlimestone rock materials were manually sorted with tweezers and kept. A small sediment sample of each XU of each square was also kept for sediment analyses (e.g. pH, Munsell colour, particle size analysis, organic carbon analysis) prior to wet sieving. Pollen samples were collected at 5 cm depth- intervals by pushing new sample phials into the sediment profile after completion of each of the Squares P34– P35 and R31 excavations. eDNA samples were collected from each XU in Square R31 during excavation, and again from the side walls of the sequence under full protective gear (to avoid contamination by the collector) following completion of the excavation. These latter results will be presented elsewhere.
The subject of the present paper is the faunal bone remains from Square R31. The square was excavated from c. 20 cm to 153 cm depth against the northeast wall of Flood's 1971– 1972 pit (the missing top c. 20 cm of the deposit, representing Stratigraphic Unit [SU] , had been removed in the 1970s, and the underlying sediments protected by plastic sheeting covered with a protective layer of imported sediment ) . The entire excavated deposit was well stratified, and radiocarbon ages of 43,412– 46,763 cal BP (42,547 ± 920 BP, Wk- 51,144, at 95% probability range) near the base are corroborated by an OSL age of 46,930 ± 4150 years for underlying deposits to the side nearby (David, Arnold, et al., 2021 ) . The Bayesian analysis of 69 AMS radiocarbon and two single- grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages indicates that the Square R31 excavated sequence begins at its deepest levels with the mixed SU5A, dated to between 25,640 and 48,470 cal BP, and ends with an uppermost series of ash layers (SU2A– SU2D) dated to between 1460 and 3360 cal BP (all the Bayesian- model ages cited are given at % probability ranges) (David, Arnold, et al., 2021; David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al., 2021; Mialanes et al., in press; Stephenson et al., 2020 ) . While the chronostratigraphy has good integrity, the sediment sequence contains many distinct layers. Minimal reworking has occurred, except for the lowermost SU5A of Square R31, which consists of sediments mixed by massive roof- fall. Beneath SU5A is SU5B, the well- stratified deposit that contains the in situ megafaunal remains excavated by Flood in 1971– 1972 along the northeast wall slightly below and to the south of the base of Square R31. Here an OSL age of 51,830 ± 5510 years was obtained from the location of the Simosthenurus occidentalis remains (see David, Arnold, et al., 2021; Delannoy et al., 2020 ) . .3 | Faunal analyses
Following laboratory sorting, all the animal bones from the ≥2 mm fraction were air- freighted to McDowell at the University of Tasmania for analysis. Diagnostic bones (whole and part skulls, maxillae, dentaries and/or teeth, reptile vertebrae, frog ilia and bird bones) were identified using published descriptions and comparative material held by the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. All specimens were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10410 by University of Adelaide Alumni, Wiley Online Library on [13/11/2022 ] .

MCDOWELL et al. ( usually species for mammals, but rarely past order for reptiles and birds ) . Bones and teeth were also assessed for quality of preservation, burning, breakage, taxonomy, species activity schedule, species body mass and ecological characteristics (see Appendix S1 ) . The number of identified specimens (NISP) was calculated for each species, then converted to relative abundance (Ri%) and ecological guild abundance (i.e. species that use resources or habitats in similar ways) to facilitate comparisons between samples (see McDowell et al., 2012, 2015; McDowell, Eberhard, et al., 2022 ) . Species were grouped into habitat guilds (see Appendix S1; Figure 3 ) , plotted on a linear timescale and overlain with palaeotemperature records derived from oxygen isotopic ratios measured from the Vostok ice core (Jouzel et al., 1987, 1993, 1996 ) . This was done to investigate temporal trends relative to environmental conditions and climate change.
Diagnostic bones were dominated by mammals, though bird, frog and reptile bones were also excavated (Tables 1 and 2 ) . Compared with mammals, bird and reptile bones have fewer diagnostic features, making them more difficult to identify beyond family. Because birds and reptiles were rarely identified to species, richness, relative and guild abundance and temporal trends are based on mammals only. .4 | Taphonomy
When bones are found to be concentrated in cave sediments, a predator is often responsible. Each predator accumulates a uniquely biased sample of the community it preyed upon. Prey characteristics can therefore be used to identify the predator. An investigation of Cloggs Cave's taphonomy can tell us a lot about the agent of bone accumulation. Here we assess bone breakage, preservation, degree of burning, prey species activity schedule and prey species body size. Animal body size was divided into three categories, small = 5 kg animals, to help understand how the fauna, or their remains, may have entered the cave (see Appendix S1 for details ) . | RESULTS .1 | Species composition
The fauna recovered from Square R31 is dominated by small mammals and, despite being very close to a permanent watercourse, lacks mussel shells. We note that there are numerous mussel shells brought by Aboriginal people hundreds and thousands of years ago in the rockshelter outside the cave, but there are none in the cave deposit. While the volume of each XU making up the Square R31 excavation is small, the number of specimens yielded is fairly large. McDowell identified 4886 diagnostic specimens that represent at least 31 taxa (one echidna; five carnivorous marsupials; at least two bandicoots; two pygmy possums; one sugar glider; one feathertail glider; one ringtail possum; one potoroo; one extant long- faced kangaroo; one extinct short- faced kangaroo; nine rodents; at least one insectivorous bat; at least two frogs; at least three lizards and several unidentified birds; Tables 1 and 2 ) . The vast majority of bones identified to genus and/or species (97.4%) consist of nocturnal mammals that have a maximum body mass of 200 g or less. Species with a maximum body mass that exceeds 900 g were predominantly represented by juveniles. Two murid rodents encountered during this research (Pseudomys higginsi, Long- tailed Mouse; and P. fumeus, Smoky Mouse) proved difficult to differentiate. Some P. higginsi specimens were identified with confidence, but the majority of specimens were identified as undifferentiated P. fumeus/higginsi. Both species occupy open forest with dense heath to grassy understorey and have similar dietary preferences that include seeds, fruits and hypogeal fungi (Van Dyck & Strahan, 2008; Walton, 1988 ) . Consequently, for the purposes of this paper we combine specimens attributed to these two species during analysis. .2 | Taphonomy

MCDOWELL et al. most bones came from nocturnal small mammals, the agents of accumulation caused little mechanical or digestive damage to the bones of their prey. Although the remains of the Eastern Quoll Dasyurus viverrinus were found in the assemblage, there is no evidence of mastication by mammalian predators. Few of the mammals identified are considered human food species. Body size analysis shows that small mammals (1 kg) remains are rare. The rare instances of bones from medium- sized and large animals are usually represented by juveniles. In contrast, small mammal bones are abundant. Figure 4 shows a complete murid skull photographed in situ in the exposed stratified section c. 1.5 m from Square R31. The various bones in this murid skull and many others like it excavated from Square R31 remain articulated and intact. Along with the presence of abundant small and often whole mammal bones in discrete stratigraphic layers, their presence in near- laminar strata demonstrates the chronostratigraphic integrity of the bone assemblage. Almost all bones are well- preserved but brittle, but with some breakage. Almost all of the breaks observed are fresh, suggesting they occurred during excavation or transport of the excavated deposit. Furthermore, none of the bones examined show evidence of cut marks, deliberate breakage, crushing/chewing or digestion. Almost all bones are burnt but very few are burnt past black. Square R31's stratigraphy includes numerous ash layers from deliberately lit fires in the cave, especially in the upper layers (SU2A– SU2D) dating to – 3360 cal BP. Most of these fires burnt to ash indicating that the material burnt was not substantial enough to produce macrocharcoal, nor enough heat to prepare meat foods. Two to 2.5 m away in Square P35, the ash layers continue unabated. Here the fires had burnt around a standing stone, indicating ritual activities (for details, see David, Fresløv, Mullett, Delannoy, et al., 2021; David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al., 2021; Mialanes et al., in press ) . | DISCUSSION .1 | Taphonomy
Masked Owl's almost exclusively prey on small terrestrial and scansorial mammals that mostly weigh 25– 125 g (Kavanagh, 2002 ) . In contrast, Sooty Owls prey on a much wider range of species, encompassing arboreal, terrestrial and scansorial mammals weighing – 900 g including species that exceed their own body weights ( Kavanagh, 2002 ) . As 97.4% of the Cloggs Cave assemblage was comprised of mammals with an adult body weight of 200 g or less, and prey with an adult body weight of 900 g were rare and predominantly represented by juveniles, the Cloggs Cave assemblage was most likely accumulated by Masked Owls.
While Cloggs Cave was clearly used by the Old Ancestors, few of the excavated bones were from large mammals (e.g. kangaroos) and none appear to have been processed as food. In contrast, Flood (1973) reported copious amounts of bone from food Scientific name

MCDOWELL et al. remains in the rockshelter area and entrance passage (see Delannoy et al., 2020, p. 11) outside the cave, indicating that the open area in front of the cave was an important occupation site, in contrast to the cave that was not used for animal food preparation or consumption.
Bones from the upper layers of Square R31 have been subjected to repetitive low- temperature burning, a process that can only be attributed to people. Bones excavated from the upper 23 XUs were consistently burnt brown- black (350– 400°C) (Marques et al., 2018 ) , but very few were burnt grey or calcined. This indicates that bones were rarely subjected to the higher temperatures (600– 800°C) that are usually achieved in hearths used for cooking meat. These findings are consistent with Hope's (1973) observations based on material excavated by Flood in 1971– 1972. .2 | Fauna
Some of the species recovered from Square R31 show strong trends of species abundance change over time (Figure 5 ) . Pseudomys fumeus/P. higginsi, and to a lesser extent, A. swainsonii (Dusky Antechinus) became less abundant through time. P. novaehollandiae ( New Holland Mouse) was initially present in low numbers (SU4U– SU5A, dating within 24,070– 48,470 cal BP ) , followed by a period of absence (SU4M– SU4U, dating within 16,770– 25,740 cal BP ) . Its abundance then rose dramatically (SU4A– SU4M, dating within – 18,970 cal BP) to contribute more than 30 Ri% but then fell to Ri% (SU2– SU4C, dating within 1460– 11,580 cal BP ) . Sminthopsis sp. cf. S. leucopus (White- footed Dunnart) increases slightly in abundance over time (SU2– SU4H, dating within 1460– 15,960 cal BP ) . Rattus fuscipes (Bush Rat ) , R. lutreolus (Swamp Rat) and P. oralis (Hastings River Mouse) were stochastically present or absent in low numbers initially (SU4M– SU5A, dating within 16,770– 48,470 cal BP ) , but increased in abundance towards present (SU2– SU4P, dating within 1460– 23,450 cal BP; Figure 5b ) . Mastacomys fuscus (Broadtoothed Mouse) was abundant in SU4U– SU5A which accumulated within 24,070– 48,470 cal BP just before the Last Glacial Maximum Common name

MCDOWELL et al. ( peak of the last Ice Age ) , but became less common in SU4M– SU4P, dating within 16,770– 23,450 cal BP. It then increases in relative abundance from the end of the peak of the last Ice Age, or end of the last glacial maximum (LGM ) , to the top of the excavation, dating to c. 1460 cal BP.
Pseudomys higginsi (long- tailed mouse) is presently restricted to Tasmania. It has been collected from several fossil assemblages on mainland Australia, such as Wombeyan Caves in NSW (Hope, 1982 ) , Pyramids Cave in eastern Victoria (Wakefield, 1972b) and Mitchell River National Park also in eastern Victoria (Roberts et al., 2020) and King and Flinders Islands in Bass Strait (Driessen & Rose, 1999) and Kangaroo Island (McDowell, 2013; McDowell et al., 2015 ) . On the southeastern Australian mainland, it was previously thought that P. higginsi became extinct in the Late Pleistocene (e.g. Theden- Ringl et al., 2020; Wakefield, 1972a ) . Unfortunately, these fossil assemblages are poorly dated and P. higginsi is difficult to separate from P. fumeus, making it difficult to assess when and why P. higginsi became extinct on mainland Australia. Nevertheless, recent archaeological excavations at Wangangarra 1 rockshelter, and now Cloggs Cave, both in GunaiKurnai Country, have revealed their bones in Middle to Late Holocene contexts. Therefore, P. higginsi may have survived on mainland Australia until much later than previously thought.
Pseudomys higginsi prefers cool temperate rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest, wet scrub and alpine boulder fields/scree slopes ( Van Dyck & Strahan, 2008 ) . In contrast, M. fuscus prefers grassland. For many thousands of years in the past, M. fuscus was more widespread than today, but is thought to have retreated to higher altitudes as Holocene global warming intensified (Green, 2002; Green et al., 2008; Woinarski et al., 2014 ) . If P. higginsi still occupied the region, it too would have retreated to higher altitudes, only to face elevated competition with M. fuscus and other native mammals. The minimum body weight of M. fuscus (97– 145 g; see Appendix S1) exceeds the maximum body weight of P. higginsi (50– 90 g; see Appendix S1 ) . Therefore, interspecies confrontations would almost certainly have resulted in the demise of P. higginsi, driving it to local extinction, perhaps hundreds of years prior to the arrival of Europeans. .3 | Megafauna
A single adult premolar of Procoptodon gilli, the smallest of the shortfaced kangaroos, was found in XU50 at the SU4V– SU5A interface, in the mixed sediments dating to 24,760– 48,470 cal BP. This represents the third megafauna species recovered from Cloggs Cave. The tooth had no dental wear and lacked roots, indicating it had not yet erupted and was still developing inside the ‘crypt’ when the animal it originated from died. Finding an isolated tooth at this stage of development indicates the parent skull had experienced high energy transport and was broken, releasing the tooth. This is consistent with both the condition of the tooth and features of the mixed layer it was recovered from.

MCDOWELL et al. .4 | Habitat guilds
To aid interpretation of faunal change over time, species were combined based on their habitat guilds (see Appendix S1 ) , then presented in 100% stacked columns on a linear time- scale (Figure 3 ) . We expected grassland and perhaps heath- dwelling species to dominate sedimentary layers deposited prior to and during the LGM. We then expected to see grassland species get largely replaced by woodland/forest species as climate warmed after the last Ice Age ( see McDowell, David, et al., 2022 ) . The fauna preserved in Cloggs Cave did not conform to that model. Instead, forest/woodland species make up 25%– 75% (excluding XU13, where forest/woodland species make up 100%) of species recovered from every SU of the assemblage prior to and including the LGM, when global temperatures were substantially lower than today. Surprisingly, the abundance of grassland species increased in layers deposited during the Late Holocene, contributing almost 50 Ri% of the assemblage, at a time when woodland/forest species would be expected to dominate the landscape.
In fact, it suggests that each guild was more or less present during deposition of every SU, even though deposition occurred during the transition from the cool dry glacial conditions of the LGM (peak of the last Ice Age ) , to the relatively warm and humid interglacial conditions that followed in the Early Holocene (Barrows et al., 2002; Byrne, 2008 ) . These findings are consistent with those of Hope (1973 ) , who, from the 1971– 1972 excavations, found no change in Cloggs Cave's fauna over time. Instead, Cloggs Cave's heterogeneous fauna suggests grassland, heath and woodland/forest habitats were largely or constantly present over the past 25,640 to cal BP, a period of time known to include the LGM as well as the subsequent period of rapid global warming (see McDowell, 2013; McDowell, David, et al., 2022 ) . This suggests that the vegetation surrounding Cloggs Cave was unusually varied and persistent. These results can be explained by three potential scenarios: (1) the fossil assemblage may have been reworked (i.e. mixed ) ; (2) the complex geomorphology of the region surrounding the cave supported a diverse range of vegetation types over which owls could hunt; (3) the diverse range of vegetation types fostered by the region's complex geomorphology surrounding Cloggs Cave was persistently managed by the Old Ancestors to maintain a mosaic of vegetation patches over which owls could hunt. We cannot determine which of Scenarios 2 or 3 applies to our study, because both scenarios result in comparable bone assemblages. However, the expansion of grassland during the Middle Holocene (beginning at the SU2E– SU2F interface) cannot be easily explained except through anthropic landscape management of the surrounding region by the Old Ancestors.
David, Fresløv, Mullett, GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation, et al. (2021 ) , David, Arnold, et al. (2021) and Mialanes et al. (in press) demonstrated great chronostratigraphic integrity of the Square R31 sequence at Cloggs Cave, except for the deepest excavated layer (SU5A) dating to 25,640– 48,470 cal BP. Scenario 1 can therefore be dismissed for the past c. 25,640 years. Much of the vegetation immediately surrounding Cloggs Cave has been cleared for grazing since the mid to late 1800s (see Figure 2a ) , but even within a few hundred metres of the cave the relic woodlands/forests remain. Cloggs Cave is also <5 km west of the southern boundary of the Snowy River National Park, which preserves 20 different vegetation communities. These include Snow Gum woodlands, Ash and Manna Gum forests, heathlands and native grasslands (see https:// theau stral ianal psnat ional parks.org/the- alps- partn ershi p/the- parks/ snowy - river - natio nal- park/#nature, accessed 6 September 2021 ) . As the vegetation types preferred by each habitat guild represented at Cloggs Cave occur close to the Cave today and were probably also present in the past, Scenarios 2 and 3 are both plausible, implying that the generations of owls responsible for accumulating the Square R31 assemblage were able to hunt over a range of habitats. This does not definitively confirm or refute vegetation management by patchwork burning, also known as ‘firestick farming’ (Jones, 1969 ) , by the Old Ancestors, but it does confirm that a patchwork of vegetation communities occurred within the home range of the owl species that accumulated the Square R31 assemblage. The most logical explanation to account for the unexpected range of prey species habitat preferences would indeed be a patchwork landscape, and its persistence over very long periods of time, and cutting across periods of climate change, suggests that it was repeatedly managed by the Old Ancestors. It is ethnographically well known that Aboriginal peoples across Australia used, and in some parts of Australia continue to use, cool fires to manage vegetation communities, indicating that the entire Australian landscape is an artefact of a very long history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander management policies, strategies and practices.
The largest home range reported for the Masked Owl is ha (Minimum Convex Polygon estimates ) , or 2500 ha (Kernel Estimator method; Young et al., 2020 ) , which implies a hunting radius of 2.5– 2.8 km. A Masked owls roost is not necessarily in the centre of its home range, nor should we assume an owl's home range is circular. Masked owls are known to hunt both on the perch and on the wing, and frequently hunt at forest edges, small forest patches, riparian zones along watercourses and drainage lines in open pasture (Cooke et al., 2006; Debus, 1993; Kavanagh & Murray, 1996; Young et al., 2020 ) . This led McNabb et al. (2003) to describe them as intrinsic edge- hunters. It is therefore logical that they would take prey from forest– grassland ecotones (i.e. from the edge of the two habitats ) , resulting in a fossil assemblage with a mixed habitat signal. | CONCLUSION
We began this study at the request of GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation who wanted to better understand the history preserved at Cloggs Cave, including what the faunal remains could teach us about how the cave was used by the Old Ancestors and what the environmental conditions of the landscape outside the cave were like when the animal bones were deposited. We asked three questions of the faunal deposits: , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10410 by University of Adelaide Alumni, Wiley Online Library on [13/11/2022 ] .

MCDOWELL et al. . Is there any archaeological evidence of people having brought or processed animals in the cave? . What can the recently excavated animal bones from Cloggs Cave tell us about local and regional faunal distributions in the past? . What can the bone deposit tell us about the site and its landscape over time?
The faunal remains recovered from Cloggs Cave were, for the most part, in excellent chrono- stratigraphic order. Each XU and SU has fine- grained chronological resolution and the absolute and relative age of each XU and SU is well understood. It is therefore of great interest to find that even though the faunal remains excavated from Square R31 were evidently in situ, the ecology of the animal remains recovered does not simply reflect the temporal pattern of known major climatic conditions including the LGM (see Figure 3 ) . If sitebased patterns of faunal change do not conform well to known global climate change events such as the LGM and are known to be in situ, other factors that control species community composition must be in effect. The most parsimonious way to achieve a highly diverse fauna within c. 2.8 km of Cloggs Cave is to maintain a mosaic of habitats that support a diverse range of species from diverse habitat guilds.
While the maintenance of a range of short- spaced habitats may be partly driven by the region's complex geomorphology, this would provide refugia at best and should still be largely controlled by climate change. Therefore, the active management of Country by the Old Ancestors since at least 2130– 7290 cal BP that includes the SU2E– SU2F interface is implied by the Cloggs Cave faunal guild record. The presence of a patchwork of habitats for the entire period covered by the Cloggs Cave Square R31 sequence suggests that such active management of Country may well have had an even much longer history going back to pre- LGM times.
The vast majority of animal remains recovered from the Cloggs Cave Square R31 faunal assemblage indicate that masked owls were the primary agents of accumulation. We found little to no evidence that people were using Cloggs Cave as an animal- processing site. Our excavation yielded very few large animal bones that might provide evidence of carcass processing. The animal remains recovered from the Square R31 assemblage indicate that past local and regional faunal distributions were highly diverse and changed very little through time, to the point that active management was probably required to maintain the diverse range of habitats that defied global climate change events. The R31 bone assemblage tells us that the regional geomorphology and biogeography preserved numerous microhabitats that provided refuge to a range of species that would not otherwise have been able to persist over time.
In respect to undertaking research in and on cultural landscapes— and here we note that all landscapes are cultural, so the term ‘cultural landscape’ is somewhat tautologic, and is here used to emphasise the point— it seems self- evident that where respectful partnerships based on equitable power relations have been established, and where such research has been deemed socially and culturally acceptable by, and even better, of interest and value to Traditional Owners of sites and Country, new knowledge that can variably benefit everyone— local community land managers and Healthy Country programs, academic curiosity, educational programs, biodiversity conservation practices— can be achieved. Under such a research partnership, the findings of the faunal analyses at Cloggs Cave have indeed developed considerable new knowledge that may not have been synthesised without the establishment of such a respectful and culturally collaborative partnership.

It is paradoxical to think that throughout much of human history people were threatened by extinction from under‐population ( Biraben, 2003 ) , considering that today the question is whether we are approaching or have already reached a critical point of over‐pop‐ ulation. In the first 165,000 years of human existence, the popula‐ tion remained low, persisting at a few hundred thousand individuals globally. By contrast, the human population has changed markedly over the last 12,000 years, experiencing an estimated 1,860‐fold in‐ crease in the population size (Roser & Ortiz‐Ospina, 2017 ) .
The years of relatively constant growth were not static; how‐ ever, populations experienced boom‐bust cycles (Biraben, 2003; Tallavaara & Seppä, 2012) as resource availability changed and new tools came into existence. In the last 12 millennia, tech‐ nological and scientific developments have increased exponen‐ tially; however, this rapid development has been combined with a significant change in social norms, lifestyles and hunting tech‐ niques. It is thus difficult to make comparisons of demographic trends over time and establish driving factors of population change that hold true through multiple demographic transitions or time periods.

Abstract . The dependence of humans on nature has come into focus as the human popula‐ tion continues to grow, resources diminish and production technology stagnates – threatening human well‐being on a global scale. Numerous previous models de‐ scribe human population dynamics, in relation to a multitude of different factors. However, there are no consistent driving factors of human demography through history, which makes predicting future changes more challenging. . Here, we review the literature on human population growth from empirical data and previous models, which allows us to highlight key trends in demography and land cover changes. . We then establish an ecologically driven theory of demographic change that uses resource accessibility as a proxy for socio‐economic factors. The theory combines multiple concepts to represent 12 millennia of past population dynamics through simple human–nature relationships. . Furthermore, the model allows us to compare different scenarios related to tech‐ nological progress and land cover change, for which we find that the peak human population is highly dependent on whether technological developments continue at an exponential growth rate, or if and when there is a saturation point. Likewise, agriculture is shown to be helpful for growing the population, but nature is ulti‐ mately needed to maintain the human population.

Notwithstanding, there remain fundamental components that are required to sustain the human population that are independent of any one era – for example, food, shelter, water, inter‐personal in‐ teractions and waste removal. Is it realistic to make projections on where we are going or what could trigger a change in the current global society with what we know about past demographic transi‐ tions and various fundamental components? Early civilizations were highly dependent on resource availability; does this hold for contem‐ porary societies? Is it possible for a global system to collapse, as was the case on a smaller scale with the Easter Islanders and the Mayans? Will there be advances in technology and innovation over the coming years that allow us to continue growing indefinitely?
There was a growing trend in the 1970s and 1980s of work de‐ scribing population sustainability, highlighting the importance of monitoring population growth in tandem with discussing ecosys‐ tem sustainability. Earlier work discussed population size as a func‐ tion of the production or consumption of material goods and foods ( Schacht, 1981 ) , but this topic became taboo following the 1994 UN Cairo conference (Kopnina & Washington, 2016 ) . The idea that human population growth is responsible for degrading the natural system or part of complex feedbacks within the global environment has been considered unethical and ‘anti‐human’.
We take this opportunity to explore the dynamics between de‐ mography and resource accessibility throughout history. We intro‐ duce a new theory for modelling population dynamics in relation to the accessibility of natural land and agricultural area, which includes technological and innovative advancements. As ecologists, we focus on the importance of land cover change and ecosystem services in explaining demographic change and demonstrate how the accessi‐ bility of resources provides a reasonable proxy for socio‐economic factors. This theory is then developed into a model of bidirectional feedbacks between humans and the environment to simulate past population and land cover changes, in addition to possible future scenarios. Technological advancements are a favoured solution to maintaining human well‐being and food production as the popula‐ tion grows; however, the trajectory of technological development is uncertain, which is accounted for here by varying the rate and saturation point of technology. In addition, we investigate alterna‐ tive ways of maintaining human well‐being, other than technological advancement, such as reduced degradation rates. Given the com‐ plexity of demographic change and land management, we are not proposing to have a model that can accurately predict human popu‐ lation and land cover trends; however, we aim to provide a possible mechanism for population change and illuminate practices that are either detrimental or beneficial to the sustainability of the global human‐environment system. | HUMAN–NATURE INTERACTIONS: EXISTING THEORIES AND MODELS
Along with being controversial and taboo, modelling changes in human population and land cover has been widely debated in terms of driving factors (e.g. agricultural or medical advances; urban or rural lifestyles ) , assumptions (e.g. Malthusian or Boserupian) and feedbacks (e.g. feedbacks between fertility and mortality; feedbacks in the human‐environment system) (Motesharrei, Rivas, & Kalnay, ; Motesharrei et al., 2016; Schacht, 1981; Warren, 2015 ) . It is evident that the contemporary population is growing at a rate much faster than pre‐modern civilizations or even societies prior to the s; however, the same clarity cannot be conferred to the cause of growth. The gaps in knowledge or shifting theories are highlighted by the array of previous modelling attempts.
There is a broad diversity of theories and models describing changes in population. The discussion focuses on three main topics: carrying capacities, technological advances, and social norms and education. Modelling allows comparisons between different systems and eras, drawing commonalities and conclusions to develop theo‐ ries on demographic trends and land cover change. Previous models have attempted to capture changes in demography, generally focus‐ ing on a specific transition or period of humanity. Questions arise about the validity of model assumptions and the ability to reflect past and present trends in human population and land cover change.
Initial models of population growth were very simple and often based on everyday observations. John Graunt is credited as the first demographer to describe population growth in the 17th century as a doubling rate (Graunt, 1662 ) . This later became the basis for Malthus ( 1888 ) . .1 | Agriculture and resources
The Malthusian model of population growth has received much criti‐ cism over the years. Malthus (1888) assumes that the population grows geometrically, with adequate resources, while food produc‐ tion grows arithmetically implying that the population will inevitably decline when the number of individuals surpasses the available food supply, as a result of disease, famine or war. Malthus believed the population could either choose to reduce population growth through family planning, governed by income and status, or that the amount of resources would ultimately force a reduction in population.
Over the years, many models have applied concepts of resource consumption to describe population dynamics. From the most basic models that assume the population grows linearly with land area ( Schacht, 1981) to models linking carrying capacities, population size and warfare (Turchin, 2009 ) .
Many models focus on the availability of resources, particularly agriculture. It is widely hypothesized that agricultural production is responsible for the exponential growth in the human population ( Armelagos, Goodman, & Jacobs, 1991; Bocquet‐Appel, 2002; May, ). The Neolithic revolution, the introduction of agriculture roughly 10,000 BCE and the first established demographic transition, is well‐studied. It is evident that agricultural development allowed the population to grow at an unprecedented rate, more than doubling the previous peak growth rate that followed the introduction of special‐ ized tools in the Paleolithic Era (Biraben, 2003 ) . Much higher popu‐ lation densities can be attained using agriculture, when compared to | 33
People and Nature
HENDERSON aND LOREaU an equal area of hunting and foraging land. This trend is evidenced on a global scale (Bocquet‐Appel, 2002, 2011; Gignoux, Henn, & Mountain, 2011) and over the course of many millennia. Indeed, ag‐ riculture was primarily responsible for higher‐birth rates and lower‐ mortality rates up until the 1900s (Hirschman, 2005; Overton, 1993 ) , showing that population dynamics and land cover change were intrin‐ sically linked during this era (Woodbridge et al., 2014 ) .
However, too strong a dependence on one system, such as agriculture, can lead to detrimental effects when there is a sud‐ den shock to the system (Bocquet‐Appel, 2011; Downey, Haas, & Shennan, 2016 ) . One study suggests that up to 60% of the popu‐ lation were lost at one point from one such bust (Shennan et al., ). Similar to Neolithic agricultural practices, medieval agri‐ culture was a double‐edged sword. High production allowed the population to grow, but in times of crop and pastoral failure the population suffered (Overton, 1993 ) . Agriculture often failed as the necessary precautions were not heeded to avoid destruction of the fragile ecological equilibrium that maintains crop and live‐ stock production. Likewise, archaeological work reveals prolonged soil nitrogen deterioration, which ultimately leads to ecological stress and agricultural failings in earlier settlements.
Reuveny (2012) provides a summary of models used to explain the collapse of historical civilizations, starting with Brander and Taylor (1998 ) . Brander and Taylor's model, which was later elabo‐ rated on by many others (D'Alessandro, 2007; Reuveny & Maxwell, ; Ricardo Faria, 2000 ) , follows one main assumption: greater resource availability leads to larger populations. This model was spe‐ cifically developed to describe the Easter Island population, but fails to replicate the last two demographic transitions in the modern era. Population growth is modelled as follows, where b is the birth rate and d is the death rate. The population (L) is further enhanced by the availability of resources (S) multiplied by the utility of the resource (β ) , the efficiency of acquiring the resource (α) and a procreation coefficient (ϕ ) .
Anderies (2003) elaborates on Brander and Taylor's model to re‐ flect population changes from both Malthusian and modern growth relationships. The model describes the relationship between con‐ sumption patterns and demography: (1) higher consumption of ag‐ ricultural goods results in higher‐birth rates, (2) higher consumption of manufactured goods decreases the birth rate, and (3) greater con‐ sumption of both agricultural and manufactured goods decreases the death rate. The modifications provide a better fit with modern populations. The change in population is given by where the birth rate (b0) experiences feedbacks (b1) from agricul‐ tural goods (qa) and feedbacks (b2) from manufactured goods (qm ) . Likewise, both goods feedbacks onto death through the coefficients d1 and d2.
Other models incorporate important social factors along with carrying capacities and consumption patterns. Motesharrei et al. ( 2014) divide the population into commoners and elites, with differ‐ ent levels of consumption and therefore different death rates. This division of the population incorporates important social factors that explain differences in the stage of the demographic transition for high‐ and low‐income countries.
Before the onset of major technological advances in the 18th century, population growth dynamics could be explained by Malthus’ theory. However, the human population has managed to escape the Malthusian trap numerous times (Hirschman, 2005 ) . For example, according to Malthus the population should have collapsed in the 1900s, as growth rates exploded and agricultural expansion stagnated, presuming that agriculture would not be able to support the population. This was not the case; in reality, the United States experienced the greatest growth during this period. The yields per hectare of essential crops increased exponentially between 1930 and 1998 (Warren, 1998 ) , as a result of the Green Revolution. The population boom in the 1900s fostered the idea that technology—for example, fertilizer, machinery and genetic modification (technology of the Green Revolution ) —is responsible for human population growth. .2 | Technology and medical advances
An alternative to the resource‐dependent population growth theory was brought forth by Boserup (1965 ) , suggesting that technological advancements are a major driving factor in demographic changes. It is undeniable that the onset of new technology and tools has often coincided with rises in population growth. Dating back to the Paleolithic Era, advances in hunting tools increased population growth at the end of the era. Smil (1999) argued that the popula‐ tion explosion of the 1900s would not have been possible without the agricultural advances that increased production six‐fold over the same period (Moses, 2009 ) .
Moreover, along with technology comes advances in medi‐ cine and hygiene. There have been marked increases in population growth, since the early 19th century, as societies develop. The in‐ creases in growth have been attributed to a decline in death rates following improvements in hygiene and sanitation, enhanced nu‐ trition, early medical care and clean water (Preston, 1980; Samir & Lutz, 2017 ) .
Lee and Tuljapurkar (2008) model pre‐industrial population dy‐ namics using theories from both Malthus and Boserup. The popu‐ lation change is subdivided into different age groups and growth is calculated in terms of food consumption, winter temperatures, dis‐ ease prevalence, cultural norms, technology and social factors. The model assumes that increased agricultural productivity increases population growth and well‐being. The food availability depends on the labour force, in addition to cultivation techniques and environ‐ mental quality.
In two recent papers, Lafuite and Loreau (2017) and Lafuite, Mazancourt, and Loreau (2017) modelled the change in the human ( 1)

HENDERSON aND LOREaU population (H) as a function of technological advancement (T) and biodiversity (B ) . The model emphasizes the dependence of people on biodiversity and ecosystem services, which ultimately impact the ag‐ ricultural production that humans require. Furthermore, technology has both positive and negative influences on the human population, such that greater technological advancements in the agricultural and material goods sectors often lead to declining biodiversity, which has a negative impact on human well‐being. However, technology also acts as a proxy for improved social well‐being (i.e. improved health care, better education) which improves survival. The influence of socio‐economic and ecological feedbacks on human population size is given in the following equation:
The human population is assumed to depend on the consumption of agricultural (γ1) and industrial goods (γ2 ) , requiring a minimum per capita consumption of agricultural goods (y1min ) . µmax is the maximum human population growth rate and b2 is the demographic transition coefficient, reflecting the sensitivity of industrial goods consump‐ tion on growth. The maximum technological efficiency (Tm) is related to biodiversity and ecosystem services (Ω ) . .3 | Social norms, wealth and education
Societal views may explain many shifts in behaviour that are related to demography and land‐use. Between 1270 and present, there have been both positive and negative status–fertility relationships (Mulder, ). Over this period, those within a high occupation/social class switched from having more children to having slightly fewer children than those with low status. There has been a great deal of work trying to explain fertility rates. In general, researchers find that in regions or times of income insecurity and uncertain living conditions, individuals have more children as a means of supporting elderly or ailing parents, a form of ‘basic social insurance’ (Marchetti, Meyer, & Ausubel, 1996; Skirbekk, 2008 ) . By contrast, wealthier families try to increase the eco‐ nomic success of their offspring by providing more resources to fewer individuals (Kaplan, 1996 ) . These patterns may not exist after sudden changes or stochastic events, see for example Eberstadt (1994 ) .
In addition to income, greater education also reduces fertility rates ( Skirbekk, 2008; Smeeding, 2014 ) . Lower‐mortality rates are almost universally related to higher‐education levels (Lutz & Skirbekk, 2013 ) .
Education, wealth and technology are not independent. Factors describing social dynamics in a population are highly correlated and often difficult to tease apart, which can result in complex models with many interdependent feedbacks and processes. In an effort to find a mechanism for the demographic transition, Galor and Weil ( 2000) develop an agent‐based model, describing population size in terms of income per capita and the availability of technology. The number of children per person is a function of education, technol‐ ogy, consumption behaviours and income. The use of many inte‐ grated factors allows the model to simulate a Malthusian regime, a post‐Malthusian regime and modern growth.
Nitzbon, Heitzig, and Parlitz (2017) describe a socio‐ecological model that explores fertility and death as a function of well‐being, for which well‐being represents basic nutritional needs for repro‐ duction. Well‐being (W) is a variable linking ecosystem services and the human population with carbon (terrestrial, atmospheric and geo‐ logical ) . The premise is that the birth rate declines towards zero after the initial increase as a result of education and social security related effects. Human population (P) change is given by, where p is the maximum fertility and Wp is the well‐being for which fertility saturates due to biological limits. This function gives a non‐ linear birth rate, where population initially increases with well‐being and subsequently decreases once the saturation point has been reached. The mortality term ( q
W
) decreases linearly with well‐being. | AN ECOLOGICALLY DRIVEN THEORY OF POPULATION GROWTH .1 | Birth and death dynamics
After reviewing the theories and models on demographic change, we provide a summary of possible driving factors in human birth and death rates. Starting with a simple argument: birth rates are not in‐ dependent of death rates, specifically when it comes to under‐five mortality. If child mortality is low, the desired number of offspring is equivalent to the number of children born, allowing for better family planning (Smeeding, 2014 ) .
There is an abundance of data on demography and covariates from the last 60 years. From Supporting Information Table S1, it can be seen that fertility and child mortality are driven by the same fac‐ tors, which allows us to describe the number of individuals entering the population and contributing to further growth as recruitment.
There is a strong interconnectedness between birth, death, food, wealth, education and technology that cannot be ignored. Therefore, any model attempting to mimic changes in population growth has to take many socio‐economic and ecological factors into account. Thus, based on previous works and empirical data, we suggest that resource accessibility – defined as the availability of natural and agricultural land (Supporting Information Table S1: access to water, %GDP agriculture, % rural population ) , combined with technological and innovative advances (Supporting Information Table S1: access to electricity and sanitation, female literacy) – can be used as a proxy for socio‐economic and ecological factors.
In a recent paper by Nitzbon et al. (2017 ) , the authors used a nonlinear function to describe fertility with respect to well‐being. We apply a similar nonlinear function to describe the dependence of population change on the accessibility of resources. Initially, pop‐ ulation growth is a sign of prosperity and a greater need for labour. However, as the population reaches a higher quality of life, a shift oc‐ curs in family planning and the desire for offspring, such that higher ( 3)

HENDERSON aND LOREaU birth rates signal a downturn in prosperity (Güneş, 2016; Jejeebhoy, ). These changes in prosperity also impact consumption rates and the impact of humans on the environment. Hirschman (2005) and many before (Ehrlich& Ehrlich, 1970, 1990; Meyer & Turner, ; Vörösmarty, Green, Salisbury, & Lammers, 2000) suggest that a large and growing population puts pressure on resources and eco‐ logical systems, until the population reaches a carrying capacity and ultimately implodes. This Malthusian trap has been avoided in the past through new waves of production, medicine and technology, but whether these strategies will hold in the future is a question that remains. The factors that govern population growth are widely de‐ bated and poorly understood, suggesting that reliance on any such factor in the future could lead to unwanted outcomes.
We develop a phenomenological model of the relationship be‐ tween recruitment and death rates versus resource accessibility. Many previous models make assumptions that do not hold up to the current empirical data. In particular, when it comes to the birth rate, the factors that increased birth in pre‐modern times (food, wealth, social status) have decreased the birth rate over the past 50 to years. The theory and model developed here take into account the past 12,000 years of human population and land cover changes, combining multiple assumptions from previous works and replacing those that are not supported by past or present empirical data. This model is able to capture observed changes in human population and land cover change through bidirectional feedbacks. We use these feedbacks to make population projections under various scenarios, which is discussed in further detail below. .2 | Recruitment curve
As the birth rate and under‐five mortality rate are highly correlated and have similar driving factors, we group the two terms, describing recruitment as an increase in the population that reaches reproduc‐ tive age and has the ability to further increase the population.
Data from Supporting Information Table S1 provide support for our phenomenological representation of human population recruit‐ ment and suggest a possible mechanistic approach to explaining the recruitment rate with respect to resource accessibility. The propor‐ tion of the population that has access to electricity, sanitation and water is negatively correlated with the recruitment rate. Education, especially among women, has a strong negative correlation with the recruitment rate. Accessibility to such commodities acts as a proxy for wealth, technology, freedom and power. Contrarily, the percent of GDP from agricultural goods and the proportion of the popula‐ tion living in rural areas coincide with higher‐recruitment rates. From Supporting Information Table S1, it can be seen that resources, that is, agricultural area and natural land area, have a positive influence on the recruitment rate, while education, technology and development have the opposite effect (Figure 1a,b ) . When multiplied together, the outcome is a non‐monotonic function (Figure 1c ) .
Therefore, R is used to describe resource accessibility, defined as the combined availability of agricultural land (A) and natural land ( N ) , in addition to technology and innovation. Part of technology and innovation takes into account the quality, efficiency of extraction and equality of distribution (TA,N ) , such that R = TN ( t ) N + TA ( t ) A. The availability and access to resources are estimated from technolog‐ ical advancement data and pollen records (details are given in the Supporting Information ) . Fossil pollen records contain information about vegetation and land‐use change that can serve as a proxy for land‐use intensity (Lechterbeck et al., 2014 ) . Archaeological records reveal an increasing trend in the evolution of technology, which has greatly improved the extraction and distribution of resources. Therefore, we can assume that earlier societies were less efficient ( Marlowe, 2005 ) .
In this model, technology is described independently of popu‐ lation size. There is most likely a feedback between population and innovation (Derex, Beugin, Godelle, & Raymond, 2013; Henrich et al., ; Kline & Boyd, 2010 ) ; however, there is little empirical evidence FI G U R E 1 Crude representation of a possible mechanistic approach to modelling human recruitment. From the data in Table S1, it is hypothesized that recruitment increases linearly with agricultural resources and rural land area (a ) . By contrast, accessibility to electricity, education, water and sanitation have a negative influence on recruitment rates (b ) . When multiplied together, as is the case in our model, accessible resources = technology × land area. This gives a non‐monotonic curve for recruitment (c) that may assist in explaining demographic transitions | People and Nature
HENDERSON aND LOREaU to support the idea that larger populations foster greater technolog‐ ical development (Collard, Vaesen, Cosgrove, & Roebroeks, 2016; Vaesen, Collard, Cosgrove, & Roebroeks, 2016 ) , rather it may be the degree of interaction between subpopulations (Powell, Shennan, & Thomas, 2009 ) . We describe technology and innovation as an ex‐ ponential function (with a similar curve to human population ) , which suggests a relationship between human population size and technol‐ ogy; however population size is not the only driving factor. Given the conflicting hypotheses, we estimate curves from empirical data to describe technology and innovation, and project various future tra‐ jectories (see Scenarios section below ) , to avoid making unfounded assumptions about the feedbacks between humans and technolog‐ ical innovation.
We use our phenomenological theory and this hypothesized accessible resource mechanism to create a recruitment curve with estimated data points from various times in history (Figure 2, de‐ tails on sources for recruitment rates and calculations for accessible resources are given in the Supporting Information ) . Historical birth rates and child mortality rates are fit to an inverse Gaussian curve. The resulting recruitment equation is given by where α, β and c are coefficients describing the peak recruit‐ ment rate, when recruitment begins to increase and when recruit‐ ment begins to decline, respectively, for the Gaussian function. The parameter values are chosen to reflect empirical data for recruit‐ ment rates over the past 12,000 years (parameter description is given in Supporting Information Table S2 ) .
Resource accessibility can be greater than the actual availability of resources (R > N + A ) , if technological advancements improve the abil‐ ity to obtain resources to an extent greater than approximately dou‐ ble the present (≈8.5 billion hectares of natural and agricultural land ) . Resources can also be difficult to obtain, or of poor quality, for example in the absence of ecosystem services or nutrients, to an extent that they provide no benefits to the human population despite being abun‐ dant; in such cases, the resource accessibility would be low (R « N + A ) . .3 | Mortality curve
Using the crude death rate does not allow for comparisons between different groups of individuals. The link between crude death rate and socio‐economic indicators is less convincing (average correlation co‐ efficient magnitude for crude death rate r ≈ 0.61, for adult death rate r ≈ 0.79 and under‐five mortality rate r ≈ 0.75 ) ; however, by separat‐ ing child mortality (included in the recruitment rate) and adult mor‐ tality, we are able to highlight potential driving factors for mortality ( Supporting Information Table S1 ) . In particular, an improved standard of living (i.e. improved education, better access to health care and nutritional food, improved hygiene, etc.) rapidly shifts the death rate from high to low. We ignore migration for now, as this is a non‐spatial model. The death rate varies with resource accessibility as follows, where δ is the resource‐based death rate, calibrated to fit em‐ pirical data (Bocquet‐Appel, 2009; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017; Preston, 1996 ) , when combined with the minimum death rate, δmin. The minimum death rate is based on statistics for adult mortality rates where resource accessibility is high and thereby resource‐based death is negligible (The World Bank Group, 2017 ) . The threshold for human well‐being after which adult mortality decreases significantly uses the accessibility of re‐ sources as a proxy for improved standards of living. The well‐being threshold is represented as rn, using historical data on mortality and access to food and material goods to calibrate the threshold. | HUMAN–ENVIRONMENT MODEL .1 | Human population dynamics

For the purpose of our model, natural land (N) is simplified to reflect net degradation by humans for the purpose of agricultural develop‐ ment (ca) and natural resource use (dn ) , given by
Agricultural land (A) is similarly degraded by humans at a rate of da. The change in agricultural land is given by .2.1 | Scenarios
Technology and innovation are modelled independently of popula‐ tion size and land cover, with curves for both the natural land and ag‐ ricultural land sectors (see Supporting Information for details on TN,A curves ) . The TN,A curve grow exponentially as suggested by Kurzweil ( 2004) and similar to the increase in GDP seen in Motesharrei et al. ( 2016 ) ; however, we also include the possibility of saturating yields from technology and therefore apply logistic curves to TN,A. We alter the steepness of the curve to reflect differences in time of onset and how rapidly the change diffuses through the population.
As the interactions between humans and the land are highly variable and difficult to predict, we simulate changes over the next ,000 years under five different scenarios: changing natural degra‐ dation rates (dn ) , changing agricultural degradation rates (da ) , TN,A saturating at current levels, TN,A saturating after a 60% increase, no saturation of TN,A (saturates at 500 times the current level in ,000 years from present ) . A table of parameter values is given in the Supporting Information Table S2. The major components of the model are land cover change and change in innovation and technol‐ ogy development, therefore the scenarios involve changing the rate of agricultural and natural land degradation, saturating the degree of improvement through technology and innovation, in addition to changing the onset (γ, see Supporting Information) and diffusion pat‐ terns (ymax) of technology and innovation (TN,A ) . | MODEL PROJECTIONS .1 | Changes in resource availability
The rate of agricultural degradation has one of the greatest impacts on peak population levels (Figure 4a ) . Slowing the rate of agricultural degradation results in a lower peak population, as the changes in population transition quickly through the stage of rapid population growth depicted in Figure 5 (red line, transition 3 ) . Slower degrada‐ tion results in more stable agricultural management and when com‐ bined with advances in technology and innovation results in greater harvesting efficiency and reduced need for offspring. Therefore, the human population achieves a state of greater well‐being with access to abundant resources, technology and innovation, and by proxy knowledge, wealth and health care.
Increasing the degradation of agricultural land results in a much higher peak population, as the degradation of land and technological or social innovations (TN,A) are pulling population change in opposite directions, ultimately keeping the growth rate at high levels over a longer period. The advances in TN,A, predominantly in the agricul‐ tural sector, are masking the decline in resources, which allows the population to keep growing. However, once agriculture reaches a critically low level and technology stagnates or can no longer coun‐ terbalance the diminished supply of agricultural (A) and natural (N) resources, the human population collapses. Advances in agricul‐ tural technology are likely the cause for the peak growth rate in the s; however, the Green Revolution is an ongoing process and as the population continues to grow or as demands increase there will be a need for future technological advancements (Evenson & Gollin, 2003 ) .
Natural land degradation behaves similarly to agricultural deg‐ radation, although the impact is smaller in magnitude (Figure 4b ) . Slower degradation of natural resources leads to slower population growth and a reduced peak population. The population spends less time in the rapid growth stage, as the advances in technology and innovation (TN,A) are dominant enough to force the system past the stage of rapid growth (Figure 5, red line, transition 1 ) , given that there are adequate natural resources to supply the popula‐ tion demands. Rapid degradation of N leads to more rapid popula‐ tion growth and a sharp population decline, as resources diminish. However, the population recovers with advances in technology and innovation (TN,A ) , even in spite of dwindling natural resources. The population continues to oscillate over time until TN,A saturates ( after 18,000 years) and no longer enhances productivity, at which point the population collapses as a result of insufficient resources. .2 | Changes in technology and innovation

HENDERSON aND LOREaU is reached later, as the population remains in a state of rapid growth until resources become limited (Figure 4c ) . Shifting the onset of TN,A to an earlier period results in minimal population growth. This somewhat unexpected result occurs as the human population spends very little time in the peak population growth stage, transitioning directly from high‐birth, high‐death rates to low‐birth, low‐death rates, without the middle stages of the demographic transition (Figure 5, green line ) .
How quickly technology or innovation (TN,A) is dispersed and applied has an overwhelming influence on population growth. Increasing the steepness of the TN,A ( t) curve results in negligible population growth, as there is no explosion in the population – the middle stage of the demographic transition is forestalled. Gradually introducing and applying advances in TN,A generates a lower and de‐ layed peak population. Gradual change allows many individuals to adopt the change and encourages additional followers to join over a longer period; individuals get caught at peak growth rates for lon‐ ger and the population continues to grow until resources diminish. A particularly slow dispersal and application of technology and innova‐ tion means that rapid growth is never reached. The population grows slowly until limited by resource availability (N and A ) . Once available technological or innovative solutions no longer support the higher population levels and reduced resource capacity, the population de‐ clines (Figure 5, blue lines ) .
In many parts of the world, it has been shown that food pro‐ duction efficiency is stabilizing (Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017 ) , suggesting there is a limit in the ability to enhance production through technology. The results may seem counterintuitive, as unlimited advances in technology and innova‐ tion result in the lowest peak in population (12 billion individuals ) , considering that earlier advances in technology and innovation allowed the population to grow (i.e. Green Revolution ) . Rather in this case, future development leads to lower‐birth/death rates and a smaller decline in population. This represents a population with higher well‐being (i.e. greater resources, low‐birth and low‐death rates ) . We find that if TN,A saturates at current levels, the popula‐ tion has a higher peak population (25 billion individuals ) . Population growth begins to shift to the right of the growth curve (Figure 5, blue lines ) , as technology increases, but once it saturates the popu‐ lation falls back to the left of the curve (low‐birth, high‐death rates ) , as resources diminish—never reaching the high‐growth rate state. A % increase in the current efficiency level results in the highest population (37 billion individuals ) . Here the population gets caught at peak growth, with adequate food to sustain the population, but not enough technology to improve well‐being. This represents a low well‐being society, as food and innovation are limited, resulting in high‐birth and high‐death rates.

These results show how population growth is highly sensitive to a balance between technology and innovation (TN,A) and resource availability (N and A ) . By contrast, the land dynamics are relatively unchanged (Figure 6 ) , showing how advancements in technology and innovation enables the human population to detach from their connection to resources, until a critical decline in available resources results in a population collapse. | DISCUSSION
This study sets out to describe human population dynamics in re‐ lation to land cover and technological advancements, applying a simple model to explore past demographic and land trends, as well as possible future scenarios. The development of theories on eco‐ logical boundaries and the Earth's carrying capacity raises concerns about the sustainability of the human‐environment system. The current combination of high‐resource demands, an unprecedent‐ edly large population and waning advances in technology and inno‐ vation in resource acquisition, necessitates population stabilization or at the very least minimize resource use. Despite the seemingly trivial nature of this situation – a finite system results in a finite population – there is no consensus on what factors are crucial in securing a sustainable future for both ecological systems and hu‐ mans. Some have suggested implementing a one child policy; others suggest reducing ecological footprints, while optimists cling to the notion that technological advances will sustain population growth indefinitely.
In this work, we highlight the important role of agriculture and technology in allowing the population to expand. Likewise, we show that either natural land (i.e. ecosystem services) or continuous ad‐ vances in technology are required to prevent collapse.
What is clearly shown here is that the onset and the speed of dispersal and the application of technology or innovation determine when or if the population will explode. If innovation/technology and land area combine to give humans access to many resources very quickly, the population does not experience rapid or explo‐ sive growth, as the peak growth rate is not attained. Instead, the individuals rapidly shift from a quantity to quality of offspring per‐ spective, achieving a higher state of well‐being. To our knowledge, there are no examples of this transition on a global scale in human history, although many Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Norway have experienced relatively stable growth since the 1500s— transitioning from a high‐birth, high‐death state, typical of the mid‐ dle‐ages, to a low‐birth, low‐death, high well‐being state without a prolonged rapid growth period (Clio Infra, 2017 ) .
In contemporary societies, a portion of the world is living in a state of post‐boom, where the later generations are continuing to grow exponentially, but the birth rate is slowing with greater income. The other portion of the population had a later onset of innovation and is still at peak recruitment rates, creating a very long period of high growth (middle stage of the demographic transition) allowing the human population to expand. Growth will remain high until FI G U R E 5 Demographic transitions. When population grows slowly and reaches the peak growth rate (red line ) , there are three possible transitions: (1) technology and innovation (TN,A) force the system to a state of low‐birth, low‐death (i.e. greater well‐being, R = 12 ) ; (2) natural and agricultural land cover (N & A) decline beyond compensatory effects from technology, resulting in a high‐birth, high‐death state (i.e. lower well‐being, R = 4 ) ; 3) the system may spend significant time at peak growth (R = 6 ) , causing the population to explode, ultimately resulting in (1) or (2 ) . The blue line demonstrates intermediate growth that never reaches peak population growth (either from too few resources or lack of technology and innovation (TN,A ) ; the growth rate then declines with insufficient N & A. The green line results when there are abundant resources and rapid dispersal and application of TN,A, going from high‐birth, high‐death rates to low‐birth, low‐death rates, avoiding the middle stages of the demographic transition
FI G U R E 6 Whether technology and innovation (TN,A) will saturate as a result of waning productivity and yield is a great unknown. Here we show potential outcomes of varying the amount of improvement provided by TN,A. The solid line reflects no limit to the degree of improvement from TN,A, where efficiency grows at a continuous exponential rate. The dotted line represents a % increase in benefits received from TN,A when compared to current levels (eN,A = 1.6 ) .

HENDERSON aND LOREaU either an increase in technology and innovation, or a change in avail‐ able resources, pulls the population to one side of the curve. There are essentially two markedly different demographic transitions un‐ derway in our current society. These contrasting demographic tran‐ sitions should be further explored in a spatial model, which would allow for more cultural interactions, such as the link between evolu‐ tion of technological complexity and human populations.
The model described here cannot answer what is causing the change in technology or innovation, but by applying a range of sce‐ narios it can be seen that the peak population is highly variable de‐ pending on technological innovation time frames. Sub‐Saharan Africa provides an example of misaligned time frames, which cause high‐ growth rates. There are basic resources to support a low level of well‐ being, but there is a lag in technological innovation (i.e. education, health care, family planning and nutrition) (Luiz, 2013 ) , which would increase the quality of life and subsequently reduce fertility rates. In the absence of technological innovation, the recruitment rate remains high and the population continues to grow. The high‐resource avail‐ ability and high‐technological innovation in wealthy countries occur over parallel time frames and therefore there are many accessible re‐ sources, lower recruitment rates, greater welfare and lower growth rates. During the Paleolithic Era, technological innovation was rel‐ atively low, as were available resources (i.e. uncertain food supply ) . Therefore, the advancement of both resource availability and tech‐ nological innovation, or more accurately the lack thereof, occurred over the same time frame. With comparatively little technology to compensate for limited resources, the Paleolithic populations main‐ tained low‐growth rates. Therefore, technology and innovation can skew the population’s perception of resource accessibility, ultimately determining growth rates. Through simulations we were able to show that advancements in technology and innovation creates a sense of detachment between humans and nature or agriculture, until such a point that the dependence cannot be ignored and the human popula‐ tion declines as a result of inadequate resources.
In the model, we include a scenario in which technology satu‐ rates, based on trends demonstrating stabilizing food production yield as a result of declining technological and innovative solutions ( Food & Agriculture Organization of the United, 2017 ) . However, technology has stagnated before; for example, in the early 1900s it seemed that population would be limited by available crops, until the introduction of hybridized corn and the green revolution (Johnson, ). The green revolution is considered to be a major contributor to the exponential population growth seen in the second half of the th century. Thus, it is difficult to predict when or if the population will decline, given that there could be a revolutionary change in tech‐ nology and innovation that supports unfathomably high‐population levels. That being said, technological advances and innovation must continue in order to maintain population levels at current standards, something that we have echoed here by showing that saturating the benefits from technology and innovation leads to higher peak popu‐ lations with reduced well‐being and a greater likelihood of collapse.
In addition to technology and innovation, agriculture appears to have a critical role in determining the peak population. The human population reacts impetuously to small changes in the area of agri‐ cultural land, as depicted by a peak population greater than 40 bil‐ lion individuals followed by a population collapse when agriculture is rapidly degraded. Agriculture has been responsible for many past boom‐busts in societies (Shennan et al., 2013 ) , suggesting that agri‐ culture is a convenient tool for growing the population, but is not ro‐ bust; whereas natural resources are more robust, but once a critical loss occurs there are major consequences that may not be reversible.
The recruitment curve depicted here shares similar characteris‐ tics to the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC ) , which shows envi‐ ronmental degradation as a function of income per capita (Tamazian, Chousa, & Vadlamannati, 2009 ) . The EKC has been criticized be‐ cause at face value it appears to suggest that economic growth has a positive influence on the environment. Theoretically this may be true, but in practice this is not so obvious (Stern, 2004 ) . There are few empirical examples showing a non‐monotonic relationship be‐ tween income and environmental degradation; the theory ignores spillover, where degradation occurs in foreign environments; and the EKC does not account for the fact that before achieving declines in environmental degradation, there is a substantial increase in en‐ vironmental degradation in many cases. This suggests that there could be a threshold of no return, or the reason for decreased deg‐ radation is due to the absence of natural land to degrade. Rather than economic growth, we use resource accessibility, which neutral‐ izes many of the contentious assumptions of the EKC. Furthermore, we have attempted to fit our recruitment curve to empirical data with reasonable results. These EKC and our curve draw an inter‐ esting comparison, as economic growth could easily be translated into resource availability, suggesting that human recruitment ex‐ periences the same response to socio‐economic changes as envi‐ ronmental degradation. Furthermore, this reinforces the idea that environmental degradation, population change and socio‐economic dynamics are intricately linked.
Population growth projections, particularly projections of peak population, are difficult, as making predictions off of past scenar‐ ios is inadvisable, especially when the mechanisms are unknown. For example, the UN population projections are constantly chang‐ ing with every new publication, consistently increasing the peak population. There is most likely a limit to the global human popu‐ lation, but putting a tangible number on it seems elusive (Cohen, ). Models such as the one presented here can give ideas of qualitative trends, but should not be considered soothsayers of the future population dynamics.
That being said, the complexity of the dynamics and the in‐ ability to give precise projections should not deter modelling work on human population growth. There have been numerous models exploring particular aspects of human‐nature interactions, which provide good starting points, offer insight and often raise further questions. Here we expand on these earlier models in an attempt to use resource accessibility as a proxy for many socio‐economic fac‐ tors. We use correlations as a syndrome, not to pin point the cause a demographic change, but to provide clues to what might signal large shifts in population dynamics. | 41

To many in the field of ecology, the bidirectional feedbacks be‐ tween humans and nature are of critical importance, yet the work on coupled systems has largely been ignored (Motesharrei et al., ). Much of the past human population modelling work focuses on population change in one period of time or during a specific event, failing to account for multiple stages of the demographic transition. We introduce a recruitment function that experiences an up–down shift, analogous to what has been observed in past and contemporary societies, and additionally we offer an ecolog‐ ically driven mechanism for such a change. Theories that attempt to describe drivers of population change are complex, with no clear consensus; however, here we apply a simple concept, relating human population change to shifts in land area and technology/ innovation. These two drivers combine to give a simple ecologi‐ cally‐driven theory for the complex processes of the demographic transition over time. This approach captures past and present dy‐ namics and suggests that many of the factors that are responsible for changes in demography can be incorporated in environmental proxies. The social factors and economic factors driving changes in land change and technology/innovation advancements were certainly different over the years, but we suggest that they play into the ability of humans to access resources. We have deliber‐ ately kept the model simple, but that does not negate the impor‐ tance of sociopolitical factors (e.g. war, religion and human rights ) , which would certainly add further dimensions to the model and incorporate stochasticity into the system.
Simple models such as this one, look at the rate of change in variables, for example land or human population, not the rate of change of the driving factors. In many cases, it is the sudden change these driving factors that causes such dramatic transitions in land cover and demography, something that cannot be cap‐ tured by this model. As such, the model cannot predict the onset of a new regime (e.g. agriculture) or account for epidemics (e.g. plague ) . Nevertheless, this ecologically‐driven theory of human population growth highlights key driving factors and provides in‐ sight into a possible mechanism for demographic change. Future work will develop on the premise of sudden dramatic changes and stochasticity.

Abstract . More than 30 years after the 1988 Declaration of Belém, which we can consider an important outcome of socio-environmental movements, this reflexive paper proposes new ways of approaching indigenous local knowledge (ILK) related to the living environment and understanding its relevance in times of global socioenvironmental crisis. . Drawing upon the example of an ethnodevelopment project based on guarana production by indigenous Sateré-Mawé people in the Brazilian Amazon, two important issues are addressed. First, we reflect on how a traditional management system can contribute to both biological and cultural conservation, even when that system is inserted in new global markets and spoken about through a scientific perspective. Second, we address the challenge of incorporating ILK into conservation research by formulating a set of methodological proposals. . We show that ILK is a dynamic, adaptive and political product of local–global interactions. This leads us to defend an analysis of ILK that would focus on its processes of creation rather than on the body of knowledge that results from them, thus helping to account for ILK's vitality and the various forms of its legitimation. . At the crossroads of ethnobiology, science and technology studies, and social anthropology, these research methods seek to go beyond the inventory, categorization and structural analysis of thoughts and practices to instead privilege an analysis of the interactions between local populations and resources; at the same time, they operate across different scales and integrate actors from the beginning to the end of (sometimes long) value chains. . Such an approach aims to make visible the modes of knowledge translation and hybridization that indigenous people might implement to maintain control over their collective identities and their relationship with a changing environment. | People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON | INTRODUCTION
In 2008, indigenous Sateré-Mawé producers in Brazil published the group's first standardizing rubric, a protocol for the production of waraná sticks. Waraná is the Sateré name of guarana Paullinia cupana (Kunth var. sorbilis [Mart.] Ducke ) , an Amazonian climbing plant whose caffeine-rich seeds are consumed worldwide for their energizing qualities (Carneiro, 1931; Smith & Atroch, 2010 ) . Guarana was first discovered by the Sateré-Mawé (Clement, De Cristo-Araújo, Coppens D'Eeckenbrugge, Alves Pereira, & PicançoRodrigues, 2010 ) , who consist of about 13,000 people in Northern Brazil (IBGE, 2010 ) , who went on to develop a strong cosmological connection with the plant; it is now cultivated in various parts of Brazil. The ‘sticks’ named in the protocol's title refer to the form in which the Sateré-Mawé traditionally conserve guarana seeds. Once they are separated from the flesh of the fruit, guarana seeds are hand-washed; slowly dehydrated on the tops of large ovens; crushed and mixed with water to form a dough; and finally rolled into 20-cmlong sticks, dried and smoked. When the Sateré-Mawé wish to consume waraná, they use a stone to gently grate the end of a stick into a gourd of water and drink the resulting mixture.
The 2008 protocol describes not only the process to be followed to make waraná sticks but also how the plant should be managed and— perhaps most importantly—what waraná is for the Sateré-Mawé people. Article 2, for example, tells us that waraná is ‘the material envelope formed by the plant, the fruit, and the seed of native guarana, which is cultivated by the Sateré-Mawé for containing the spiritual principle of “Wará” (… ) ’. It also defines waraná as ‘the semi-domestic guarana obtained from spontaneous seedlings extracted from the primary or secondary forest (…) and transplanted to an open field, or born from seeds fallen in the field (…) [and] exposed to permanent cross-pollination with wild individuals (… ) ’ (CPSM, 2008, p. 2, italics added ) . The protocol goes on to explain that the transplantation of spontaneous seedlings guarantees ‘the conservation and the genetic adaptation of guarana to the natural environment’ and ensures its ‘genetic diversity’, describing the Andirá-Marau indigenous land—the demarcated territory where the majority of the Sateré-Mawé live—as the ‘ecological and cultural sanctuary of guarana’ that safeguards its ‘unique natural gene bank’.
These extracts demonstrate a cross-cultural and meticulously written discourse that borrows from local cosmology, indigenous local knowledge (ILK) related to the plant, and scientific knowledge about genetics and forest ecology. The document in its entirety establishes important connections between different forms and sources of knowledge, resource management practices and formalized projects of indigenous territorial protection. Indeed, the preparation of the protocol originated in the Waraná Project,1 an ongoing ethnodevelopment project created in 1995 by a Sateré-Mawé leader in collaboration with an Italian activist and his sustainable development consultancy ( ACOPIAMA2 ) . Both a productive and a political effort, its focus is the establishment of a transnational fair-trade value chain for the organic, ‘analog forestry’3-certified natural products produced by the SateréMawé, including waraná seeds and sticks. From this perspective, as we will later see in greater detail, the protocol also reveals an indigenous people that has organized itself in connection with a variety of actors and frameworks, including European companies; academic, political and financial partners; and a range of certification-granting mechanisms.
The main goal of this reflexive paper, based on several months of field research completed between 2011 and 2017, is to propose new ways of approaching ILK and its relevance in times of global socio-environmental crisis. By analysing the processes of knowledge creation that lie behind the protocol, we show how a traditional management system can effectively contribute to biological and cultural conservation in a dramatically changing world.
Thirty years after the Declaration of Belém (ISE, 1988 ) , which affirmed the indissoluble links between biological and cultural diversity and insisted on the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in development programming, references to ILK remain a source of ambiguity. While the notion of ‘local knowledge’ is used increasingly as a concept relating social configurations to their natural environment ( Brosius, 2004; Escobar, 1998; Fisher, 2000; Pinton, 2003; West, ), conservationists worry that ILK is losing legitimacy, relevance or accuracy in the face of shifting socio-ecological conditions and the extension of neoliberal market value chains. Such fears often reflect an understanding of ILK as a fixed and historical—rather than living and evolving—body of knowledge.
The ethnobiological approach, which is based on the description and analysis of categories of thought and practice related to the natural environment, recognizes the dynamic and adaptive nature of indigenous cultures, traditions and knowledge systems (Berkes, Colding, & Folke, 2000; Povinelli, 2016 ) . But such approaches, though enriching and necessary, remain incomplete and insufficient. From our point of view, ethnobiological studies generally fail to adequately consider the ongoing transformations, the issues at stake, and the difficulties confronted by social groups (whether or not they identify as indigenous or traditional) facing these socio-ecological changes. Ethnobiological methods can neglect to ask people about what happens to their relations with the living world in the face of processes of acculturation, cultural erosion or increasing competition for access to resources—and this neglect, in turn, tends to depoliticize ILK.
In this paper, we propose an approach to ILK that overcomes these limitations by taking into express account its political dimension. By ‘political’, we refer to the multiple interactions that take place at the global–local interface and their expressions in the field. We want to show that the dynamic and strategic character of ILK allows indigenous people to productively respond to emerging challenges at K E Y W O R D S biology of conservation, Brazilian Amazon, ethnodevelopment project, guarana, indigenous local knowledge, ontologies of plants, Sateré-Mawé | 3
People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON different scales. In this regard, and in referring to ‘local’ knowledge beyond an exclusively indigenous dimension, we insist on the importance of anchoring knowledge in its territory of application and production.
Accounting for the dynamic, adaptive and political dimensions of ILK requires that we renew the frameworks (Gilbert & Henry, 2012) and methods classically employed. Therefore—and this is the second significant contribution this paper aims to make—we formulate a set of methodological and theoretical suggestions that can help researchers to overcome the heuristic dead ends to which conventional ethnobiological inventories can lead, especially in a context of rapid global change. We call this set of proposals ‘a social anthropology of living things’.
The paper is structured in three sections. In the first section, we present the context and methods of our research by describing the Waraná Project and its centrepiece protocol of production. This will allow us to illustrate the relevance of this case study for understanding the adaptive and strategic nature of ILK. The second section draws on the case study to describe the several identified dimensions of ILK, arguing for the need to study the processes by which ILK is created rather than—or in addition to—the body of knowledge that results from those processes. In the third section, we set out the components of a social anthropology of living things. First, we present the benefits that a pragmatic approach to ILK can provide and suggest the fruitfulness of combining ethnobiological ( here, ethnobotanical) methods with methods mobilized in science and technology studies. Then, we introduce the concept of ‘plant ontologies’, showing how such ontologies can help us to understand the processes of ILK production and the broader contribution of ILK to biocultural conservation challenges. | MATERIAL, METHODS AND CONTEXT OF GUARANA PRODUCTION IN NORTHERN BRAZIL
To contextualize our study of the Waraná Project and its production protocol, we present in this section an overview of guarana production and of our research methods (Section 2.1 ) . This allows us to situate this project within a broader range of initiatives carried out by family farmers from the Amazon region to reterritorialize guarana and valorize their knowledge in a rapidly shifting socio-economic context. Then, we describe the socio-ecological relationship between the Sateré-Mawé and the plant and explain how the deterioration of this relationship led to the creation of the Waraná Project ( Section 2.2 ) . Finally, we specify how data regarding the protocol and its creation process were gathered. .1 | Questioning the local transformations of Amazonian guarana production in times of globalization
This paper grows from a decade of field research on the processes of guarana valorization in the Lower Amazonas region of northern Brazil. Besides the Sateré-Mawé, who first discovered, cultivated and probably domesticated guarana about five centuries ago in this region4 (Clement et al., 2010 ) , guarana is now cultivated commercially5 by other populations who have gradually adapted the knowledge and know-how developed by the Sateré-Mawé ( Monteiro, 1965 ) . Most of those who cultivate guarana are caboclo family farmers (and, to simplify a complex identity, these are the descendants of Amazonian indigenous people and European settlers) from the Amazon region. But guarana cultivation has also expanded to other, more productive regions of Brazil, creating a competitive economic situation for traditional Amazonian producers. .1.1 | Socio-cultural and ecological aspects of guarana production in Brazil
One of the objectives of our research was to describe the different systems of guarana production that coexist in Brazil today, including some that might imperil the conservation of the species’ biodiversity. Indeed, although the production of guarana seeds remained a regional, traditional activity through the mid-20th century, this situation changed drastically with the late-century success of national and international marketing campaigns that made soft drinks containing guarana-seed extract a hot commercial product. This success provoked a sharp increase in the demand for guarana seeds (Henman, 1982 ) , and demand has not stopped growing since ( Tricaud, Pinton, & Pereira, 2016 ) . In response to this ever-rising demand, a number of economic actors have converged on the Lower Amazonas since the 1960s to promote the ‘modernization’ and intensification of local guarana production (Congretel & Pinton, 2016 ) . Among them are soft-drink industry multinationals and the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA6 ) , a state-owned research corporation.
Over the course of the last 40 years, EMBRAPA has worked to develop and promote 20 improved cultivars of guarana with desirable characteristics such as good productivity of seeds, resistance to various diseases and high caffeine content. Such varieties also satisfy the requirements stipulated for their distribution and marketing in Brazil (which mandate, e.g. that the cultivars available be clonal cultivars ) . These requirements are related to Brazil's 1999 decision to join the UPOV (International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants) system.7 Along with its stewardship of genetic resources, EMPBRAPA works in partnership with a number of other actors (e.g. the soft drink industry, banks, public technical support organizations) to promote—and even to impose (see Congretel, 2017; Congretel & Pinton, 2016 ) —production management practices that favour larger fields, monocultures, a high use of inputs and time-consuming activities such as pruning. Notably, EMBRAPA-promoted management practices were developed with little to no reference to local knowledge of the plant. In addition, they are based on representations that differ drastically from the conceptions and expectations of local guarana producers, most of whom prize the strength and autonomy of their | People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON guarana trees rather than their high productivity or caffeine-rich content (Congretel & Pinton, 2016 ) .
Another important issue at stake is how to maintain the genetic diversity of the species while promoting the use of a limited number of clonal cultivars. The semi-domestication practices and gene exchange between wild and domestic species characteristic of the swidden cultivation systems8 traditionally used to grow guarana (Congretel, 2017; Henman, 1982) strengthen agrobiodiversity and can thus prove valuable guarantors in commercial and subsistence agriculture alike (Smith & Schultes, 1990 ) . In this regard, the different practices developed by the Sateré-Mawé and insisted upon in the production protocol are particularly interesting, especially since the contrasting EMBRAPApromoted management practices disregard most recent findings about the resilience of swidden cultivation systems.
Swidden practices have often been criticized by conservationists because they contribute to deforestation. But since forms of swidden agroforestry preserve some naturally recruiting wild tree species, require low inputs and allow for secondary forest regeneration, they are generally considered to be sustainable, environmentally friendly forms of agriculture that favour the conservation of the Amazonian forest (Lima, Skutsch, & Costa, 2011; Nepstad, Stickler, Filho, & Merry, 2008; Porro et al., 2012 ) . ILK of the ecological characteristics, interactions and trajectories of plants can assist in secondary forest restoration efforts (Reyes-García et al., 2019 ) . Given this situation and the negative consequences of the abandonment of swidden agroforestry on Amazonian forest ecosystems, better understanding how to work with and support communities—such as the Sateré-Mawé—that wish to maintain or revitalize swidden agroforestry, then, will be a valuable skill. .1.2 | Studying the trajectory of innovative local socio-ecological projects
About 4,000 tonnes of guarana seeds are produced each year in Brazil—the only country to grow guarana—and almost all are produced by small family farms (Pinton & Congretel, 2016 ) . About 75% of the harvest is now produced in the coastal parts of the Bahia region, and most of the rest in the Lower Amazonas. There, a small part of the production is consumed or sold locally, but the great majority is destined for industry. At the same time, we have noticed several initiatives that aim to sidestep this conventional value chain. Led by groups of traditional producers, they aim to add market value to their production with appeals to its geographical origins and the socio-environmental conditions of its production, and they work to connect local producers with niche markets around the world.
Because these initiatives mobilize a variety of legal and economic tools, multiple forms and sources of knowledge, and a very diverse cohort of actors as they experiment novel paths for the development of the Amazon, these projects constitute interesting attempts to build ‘new possible worlds’ in which local producers try to reconcile economic, cultural and environmental issues at the same time that they maintain control over their own development. From 2011 to 2017, we conducted a socio-anthropological survey of three of these projects, studying what their protagonists think and do with the plant and, conversely, how the plant engages them and influences their trajectories. The three initiatives we examined, all situated in the Lower Amazonas, were the Waraná Project; a farmers’ association working to obtain a geographical indication (which it obtained in 2018) for their guarana seeds; and a cooperative producing organic guarana.
Throughout the duration of our research, we carried out fieldwork with the protagonists of these projects (including guarana producers, consultants, development agencies, customers in Brazil and France, and financial and academic partners) as well as with actors invested in the modernization of local agricultural systems, including breeders and geneticists from EMBRAPA, agricultural technicians and representatives of the soft drink industry. Fieldwork mostly took the form of semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and participation in meetings and events.
Fieldwork among the Sateré-Mawé was made possible through authorizations from the Sateré-Mawé General Tribal Council ( CGTSM ) , the National Foundation for Indigenous People (FUNAI ) , local tuxauas, and each interviewee (from whom prior informed consent was obtained and recorded ) . The socio-anthropological research approach was issued all mandatory authorizations by the Brazilian Council for Research Ethics (CONEP ) . The research has been developed largely in the context of a PhD project carried out between 2013 and 2017 at AgroParisTech. For our work on the Waraná Project, we spent several months immersed in different villages of the Andirá-Marau (AM) indigenous land,9 where we conducted interviews and participant observation with indigenous producers taking part (or not) in the Project and with local authorities ( tuxauas ) . We also conducted interviews with the administrators of the project from the Sateré-Mawé Producers’ Council (the CPSM, presented below ) , attended meetings and daily work sessions at the headquarters in Parintins (AM ) , and embarked on two expeditions organized by the CPSM to buy seeds from producers and communicate about the project. We also carried out ethnobotanical surveys in the swiddens and forest patches where guarana grows and organized focus groups and participative mapping workshops. This combination of methods and approaches—a lawyer was also involved in fieldwork—allowed us to describe and characterize the many and diverse forms assumed by the specific and historical but ever-changing relationship between the Sateré-Mawé involved in the Waraná Project and the guarana plant. .2 | The Waraná Project: Connecting socio-cultural and ecological issues across scales
The Sateré-Mawé indigenous people belong to the Tupi-Guarani ethno-linguistic group, speaking the Sateré language as mother tongue (though the majority also speak Portuguese ) . Most live in small communities scattered across the Andirá-Marau indigenous land, situated on the border that separates the states of Amazonas and Pará, about 600 km east of Manaus. This forested area, spanning | 5
People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON ,886 square km and accessible only by boat, was officially demarcated by the Brazilian government in 1986, following a series of violent conflicts that erupted when different actors, including oil and gas companies, attempted to exploit some of the community's territorial resources (Lorenz, 1992 ) . If those events have weakened the Sateré-Mawé politically and socially, they have also generated opportunities for the community to organize itself and experience the power of global connections as it endeavours to solve local challenges (Figueroa, 1997; Wolf, 2012 ) . .2.1 | Not any guarana is waraná: From local cosmology to plant management practices
For over five centuries, the Sateré-Mawé have developed strong material, cosmological and epistemological connections with guarana. In relation to their founding myth (Figueroa, 1997 ) , the Sateré-Mawé consider themselves the ‘sons of guarana’—or rather of waraná. In addition to understanding the plant as the origin of their people, they also consider it their main source of knowledge and their main tuxaua, a respected authority and counsellor who fosters good thoughts and wise decisions through the consumption of the seeds. In the Sateré language, the term waraná reflects the epistemic authority of the plant: it is the ‘beginning (-na) of all knowledge (wará- ) ’ or ‘explanation’. Sateré-Mawé people do not consume guarana seeds only for their physiological virtues, then: taken at social occasions, the waraná’hy (‘water of guarana’, guarana sticks grated and diluted in a water-filled gourd that circulates from mouth to mouth) is shared to ensure the circulation of wará (‘thoughts’ or ‘knowledge’ ) , generate ‘good speech’, and guide learning and decision-making processes (Congretel, 2017; Figueroa, 1997 ) . However, though this ritual constitutes a founding principle of knowledge and guides the community's reflections and decisions, its profound signification has eroded in recent decades with the diffusion of the national educational system and its competing knowledge claims. Revitalizing the epistemic authority of waraná is one of the issues addressed in the protocol.
In relation to the cosmological status of the plant, for the SateréMawé, not any guarana is waraná. Local management of the resource and production practices play important roles in this regard. For the Sateré-Mawé, wará is contained only in the seeds of ‘true guarana’ ( waraná sese) or ‘mothers’, vines that grow spontaneously in the forest (ga'apy ) , and in the seedlings that germinate spontaneously at their feet, or ‘sons’. Consequently, the Sateré-Mawé never sow guarana seeds but transplant ‘sons’ from the forest into small clearings near the villages, where they are grown alongside other useful species such as fruit trees, tubers, etc. Maintaining a direct lineage between forest-dwelling ‘mothers’ and transplanted ‘sons’ ensures that wará is retained in the seeds and—not a point of minor importance— that the Sateré-Mawé maintain their identity as ‘sons of waraná’ through the consumption of those seeds. Planting clonal seedlings of improved cultivars is, in this sense, inconceivable: these have no lineage with the forest mothers and therefore contain no wará at all.
The 2008 protocol makes the transplantation of forest seedlings the only production practice authorized, presenting the forest ‘mothers’ as ‘wild individuals’ and the ‘sons’ transplanted to the swiddens as ‘semi-domesticated’. Before further analysing this discourse and its motivations through a social anthropological lens, it is important to note that, according to geneticists, guarana is probably an entirely domesticated species (Atroch et al., 2012; Clement et al., 2010 ) : in other words, there is no wild guarana. According to the authors mentioned, the species of guarana currently known and cultivated results from a fortuitous and unique genetic crossing.10 We discuss the implications of this affirmation later (in Section 3.3.2 ) ; what is important to observe here is that the protocol's description of the transplantation practice was conceived of not only as a tool to give commercial value to waraná but also to present the related knowledge and know-how (savoir-faire) reconfigured, rethought and mobilized by the producers engaged in the Waraná Project. .2.2 | Genesis and purposes of the Waraná Project
Founded in 1995, the Waraná Project takes as its objective the creation of a local economy capable of backing Sateré-Mawé claims for cultural and political autonomy and for securing their territorial rights (Barthel & Erhardt, 2008 ) . Based on the organic production and fair trade of guarana seeds and other local natural products, the economy generated would serve to improve infrastructures in the indigenous area, build local education and health systems based on traditional knowledge and epistemology, and foster a cultural revival. Indeed, among the main concerns of the project's leaders are the Sateré-Mawé’s increasing dependence on the State for income and the erosion of their culture (Palma Torres, 2010 ) . The project also aims to prove that the group's land is productive and should therefore be respected.
By 2017, about a hundred families were involved in the Waraná Project. It is administered and managed by a ‘head’ group of six people, most of whom are guarana producers, who lead the Consortium of Sateré-Mawé Producers (CPSM ) , and supported still by the consultant who co-initiated the project. The CPSM, a collective autonomous entity created in 2008, assembles all the producers involved in the project and functions according to democratic principles.
The ‘Protocol for the production of waraná sticks’ was also created in 2008; its genesis, which involved numerous actors (managers of the CPSM, producers, consultant and others) and developed through a participative process of knowledge production and selection, is presented in Section 3. We gathered our data regarding this process, during which we were not present, through interviews with the actors involved. Data regarding the result of this consultative process—that is, the protocol document itself—come from our translation and analysis of the document. The protocol consists of nine articles, all written in both the Portuguese and Sateré languages. A reverse translation from Sateré to Portuguese has allowed us to assess the differences between the two versions | People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON and to develop an understanding of how ‘scientific’ elements were translated.
While the protocol's vocabulary is partly scientific and derives from scientific ecological knowledge, its primary motive is to emphasize the Sateré-Mawé epistemology—in other words, how they come to know things through the plant and how they use this knowledge to intervene on their situation and find their place in a globalized world. In this regard, the protocol (and the management system it describes and broader ethnodevelopment project in which it is inserted) offers a highly relevant case study for considering the role that ILK can play in a context of global socio-environmental crisis. | RECONSIDERING ILK AS A POLITICAL AND ADAPTATIVE COUPLING OF THE LOCAL AND THE GLOBAL
In the wake of the socio-environmentalist movements of the 1990s, the relationship between cultural and biological diversity has been frequently addressed through the concept of traditional ecological knowledge or TEK (Berkes, Folke, & Gadgil, 1994; Inglis, 1993; Johannes, 1989 ) . TEK refers to ‘a cumulative body of knowledge and beliefs, handed down through generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment’ (Berkes, 1993, p. 3 ) .
The term thus simultaneously attests to the ancient origins of these forms of knowledge and indicates their situated basis in local natural environments, raising questions about the relationships between knowledges produced by local populations about local natural history and those that emerge from within scientific ecology ( Roué, 2012 ) . At the same time, however, the term TEK risks ‘translating’ and reducing these forms of traditional knowledge under the rubric of scientific ecology; and, in describing these knowledges as ‘traditional’, it risks suggesting situations of exclusivity, identity and historical depth that become increasingly slippery (Pinton & Grenand, 2007 ) . In addition, this term tends to depoliticize the recognition of these forms of knowledge by presenting them as part of a completed historical process. Our choice to speak of ‘local’ rather than ‘traditional’ knowledge, specifying their indigenous character but not the specific ecological domain, then, seeks to avoid these pitfalls.
In this second section, we argue for an enlarged framing of ILK that takes into account political and strategic dimensions. Drawing from an analysis of the conditions and processes of knowledge production and selection which led to the validated version of the 2008 protocol, we show that political and strategic dimensions indeed contribute significantly to ILK's relevance and accuracy in contemporary, shifting socio-ecological conditions. In doing so, we emphasize the need for renewed approaches to ILK that attend carefully to the processes through which ILK is informed, created, transmitted and used rather than focusing only on its contents and cognitive organization. .1 | ILK as a mediation with the world
Anthropological studies have shown that most people holding localized knowledges are now implicated in processes of globalization, whether or not they wish to be (Escobar, 2001 ) . We argue here that, in order to continue existing, indigenous and local populations need to defend and adapt ‘a’ local knowledge—conjoined with its related practices and discourses—to the ever-evolving overlaps of scales that define globalization; this adaptation, furthermore, must be underpinned by strategic political choices. .1.1 | The issue of finding a place in a globalized world
Although the Sateré-Mawé consider themselves to be the descendants of guarana, they are not unaware that guarana, in addition to its traditional cultivation and mythological character, also takes on other forms of identity: it is a nationalized genetic resource; a primary resource for the soda industry; a protected set of improved cultivars promoted by EMBRAPA; and even a ‘super-food’ consumed in diverse forms throughout the world. Consequently, guarana is the object of claims and strategies of appropriation concerning not only its botanical and scientific history but also ones about the history of the peoples and territories where it is found. Keeping in mind that the Sateré-Mawé belong to an agronomical, commercial and juridical universe that is both globalized and competitive is essential to understand how they reconfigure their knowledge and know-how and the ways they use it in different globalized contexts.
In this evolving context, the Sateré-Mawé (re ) consider and present their production of guarana in a way that links their representations with the places that they wish to occupy, roles they want to have, ways they want to be seen in a globalized world and global forces that they must contend with. For example, given the way they manage their guarana, it is impossible for the Sateré-Mawé to have it recognized as a single cultivar and hence protect it as intellectual property (Filoche & Pinton, 2014 ) . Neither is it feasible for them to adopt the improved cultivars promoted by EMBRAPA, since these do not correspond to their own representations of what ‘good’ guarana is and lack the attributes that confer on guarana its cosmological role as ‘guide’ of the Sateré-Mawé people (Congretel, 2017 ) . Their development project thus pursues other paths, other forms of valorization of the plant and other strategies for relating these to their socio-political goals. One such path lies in linking their knowledge and practice regarding guarana to the global public debate regarding the sustainability of resources. .1.2 | Linking ILK to debates about resource sustainability
The opening of markets and the strengthening of environmental concerns have elevated the matter of resource sustainability worldwide. | 7
People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON
As a result, the relationships between societies and their natural environments are transformed as these are drawn into relation with global public debates (Thomas & Boisvert, 2015 ) . The Sateré-Mawé involved in the Waraná Project are aware of global trends in sustainability and conservation policies concerning tropical forests and understand how indigenous groups are viewed and positioned relative to those trends ( Conklin & Graham, 1995 ) .
Social groups or local communities may be tempted to reimagine their relations with the living things that surround them—plants, animals, soils, forest environment, etc.—according to the representations of themselves that they wish to present to global society (Carneiro da Cunha, 2010 ) . In other words, they may attempt to find new ways to perform or represent their interactions with their environments so that outsiders more easily understand them as good environmental stewards. This, in turn, can allow local communities to retain control over their mode of cultivation and continue traditional practices of gathering wild plants from sustainable natural forest populations.
It is partly with this goal that the Sateré-Mawé engaged in the Waraná Project claim, through their protocol and communication via various media (social networks, website, public events ) , that their production practices are sustainable, both in terms of biodiversity conservation and in the fair working conditions experienced by the producers. Since 2012, these efforts have been validated with the award of several certifications and labels that aim to make the group's waraná attractive to a niche clientele operating mainly in organic and fair trade markets in the global North. For example, Sateré-Mawé waraná has been granted a certification as ‘analog forestry’11 and status as Slow Food ‘Presidium’. This status, named after the Italian word for ‘sentry’, is awarded to products from a ‘quality production threatened with extinction’ (Baldereschi, Ciociola, Giannini, Milano, & Ponzio, 2015 ) . The production concerned must ‘protect a single region and an ecosystem’ and contribute to ‘maintaining traditional processing methods [and] safeguarding native breeds and varieties of local plants’.12 In other words, Presidia products are sentries meant to defend biocultural diversity.
This latter certification is worth some elaboration, since analog forestry is itself an excellent example of how traditional and scientific knowledge have been successfully integrated. Analog forestry is a holistic form of forestry that seeks to minimize external inputs such as agrochemical products and fossil fuels and to maintain forests’ ecological functions to ensure their resilience and productivity. The Forest Garden Product (FGP) certification was created in the early 2000s and is now recognized by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM Organics International, ). It consists of a set of norms guaranteeing that products are sourced from an organic and diversified environment and produced in accordance with accepted social criteria. These norms formalize principles found in many ‘forest societies’, drawing on the strengths of the traditional paradigm of forest home gardens, patches of cultivated land dominated by trees and perennial shrubs and assuming a forest-like system appearance (Senanayake, 2000 ) . An analysis of FGP certification criteria shows that they are broad and flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of forest production systems ( IAFN, 2014) that differently—but successfully—facilitate a ‘natural process of seral succession’ and maintain the ‘fertility and biological activity of the soil’. .1.3 | Combining issues to build networks
Despite the place-based nature of ILK, the involvement of local populations in a globalized and connected world requires that they find allies with whom to construct and consolidate their projects. As Sateré-Mawé leaders struggled to valorize guarana on the international stage without losing control of its production conditions, it proved important to link their knowledge and know-how with the local bioclimatic conditions and with the scientific bases for conservation. Together, these aligned the political dimensions of their project and determined the sorts of partnerships they established.
The certifications attributed to the products derived from waraná connect the Sateré-Mawé producers to a large network of consumers and, more broadly, to actors promoting agroforestry, environmentally friendly agriculture and biocultural diversity. Among these are mixed companies, private and public development agencies and foundations, governmental actors and the academic world with whom the producers can interact. Most of these actors were involved in the writing of the 2008 protocol, sharing ideas that joined together different experiences of the plant, objectives and knowledge registers so as to consolidate the partnership between network members at the same time that it addressed the producers’ main goals. .2 | Processes of ILK transformation .2.1 | Reshaping ILK through participation
Another important element of the political character of local knowledge resides in the emphasis on the participation of local populations as a touchstone of development (Olivier de Sardan, 2001; Pinton & Grenand, 2007 ) . While the Waraná Project was initially placed under the control of the General Council of the Sateré-Mawé tribe (CGTSM ) , whose members include the tribal elders, an appeal to participatory processes led to the creation of the CPSM in 2008, more than 10 years after the birth of the project. Since then, all decisions concerning the management of resources, the production or commercialization of guarana, and the production of other agroforestry products such as urucum Bixa orellana and andiroba Carapa guianensis are voted on by the assembly of all members (Congretel, ). The construction of the protocol was no exception, emerging according to the democratic principles that regulate the functioning of the CPSM.
The knowledge described in the protocol is the fruit of a process of discussion and ‘participative selection’ about what constitutes ‘good’ guarana (waraná) and how this should be produced. Most of this process took place during a 3-day assembly that brought together about guarana producers involved in the Waraná Project (mostly elders | People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON of the community ) , the head-directors of the CPSM, Sateré-Mawé teachers, the Italian consultant (ACOPIAMA) and a group of Brazilian students funded by the Amazonas State Research Support Foundation ( FAPEAM) who had interviewed several dozen guarana producers across the indigenous area and helped to compile a draft protocol.
The draft protocol served as a basis for the assembly's discussions, during which certain elements of product definition and production practice were easily validated, others bitterly discussed and others finally rejected. The main challenge was finding acceptable compromises between the demands formulated by the certifying organizations, which were based on ecological and social criteria, and those of the producers. Drawing on their individual and collective understanding of the past as well as on their visions for the future, producers’ demands combined the desire to revitalize practices guaranteeing the plant its central role in Sateré-Mawé society with the desire to improve difficult working conditions. For example, traditional Sateré-Mawé guarana cultivation practices require tedious labours to maintain the swidden plots, such as the building of jiraus, traditional wooden stakes that support the plant's branches and prevent certain diseases. The difficulty of this practice had led many producers to abandon it, and it had to be debated whether the group, in its collectivity, wanted to revitalize it or not. Another example lies in the suggestion to ban the use of plastic tools (such as buckets) and rely instead on tools made with local materials; that suggestion was ultimately rejected by the producers. In the end, the debates and writing process resulted in the definition of production practices that were both traditional and ecological and that made sense to the producers without privileging or yielding on any of the dimensions.
When the discussions concluded, the final protocol was written ( in Portuguese) by the Italian consultant with the assistance of ecologists from the Federal University of Amazonas; it remained under the oversight of the CPSM. The protocol was then translated into Sateré, using circumlocutions to construe concepts that do not exist in the Sateré language, and distributed to producers. It also became the subject of many outreach actions in the different Sateré-Mawé communities, aiming to make producers aware of the multiple commercial, political and cultural issues at stake in respecting the protocol that they had themselves played a major role in defining.
The participative process invoked in the definition of this protocol shows us that knowledge is something that is transmitted, selected and circulating, and that the processes of knowledge selection correspond to the adoption of particular strategic alliances and political positioning that emerge within a given global context. This contrasts markedly with an understanding of knowledge conservation as a form of heritage, which maintains a position of indifference as to whether or how knowledge is used, updated, or taught. .2.2 | Reshaping ILK through the hybridization of knowledge registers
The circulation of ILK transforms its contents through processes of selection and adaptation—but this is not the only way in which ILK is shaped and reshaped. It is important to recognize also that ILK is open, including to other forms of rationality such as science. New inputs and influences must be approached with great sensitivity when they engage ILK, due to its unique interactions with the natural world, making it a situated or contextualized knowledge ( Altieri, 2004 ) . In the case of sustainability, the range of actors engaged in the construction of a supply chain or project diversifies the sources of knowledge being used and the world-visions associated with them. In this case, then, the implementation of certifications serves as an instrument that brings these various sources and forms of knowledge together and makes different rationalities meet.
In the development of the protocol, it is possible to identify not only processes of knowledge innovation and readjustment but also the mixing (métissage) of different forms of knowledge. What seems important for us to explore here is the way in which confrontations are managed, what translations are carried out (Callon, Lascoumes, & Barthe, 2001—see also Section 4.3) and what is constructed as a ‘negotiated commons’ across the supply chain. It is important to note, too, that the processes of integrating different forms of knowledge and worldviews across a supply chain can complicate and refuse simple binary oppositions such as those between tradition and modernity or between the emic perspective and the etic. The emic perspective comprehends knowledge and representations as they are interiorized, lived and formulated by the people being studied themselves; the etic perspective refers to scientific methods and classifications and assumes an objectified ‘from the outside’ view ( Berthe-Friedberg, 1991 ) .
Discussions between all the actors involved in the design of the protocol forced different perspectives on what ‘good’ guarana is (and the related ‘good’ ways to cultivate and process it) to meet and hybridize as the final version of the protocol took form. The knowledge presented in the document does not merely juxtapose the emic perspectives of each different actor (producer, certifier, commercial partner and so on) on those matters but intertwines them. The statement defining waraná as consisting of ‘wild’ vines and ‘semi-domesticated shrubs’ related by gene flows through cross-pollination (Art. 3) is a good example. It results from a translation of the Sateré-Mawé's own cultural understanding (emic perspective) of what waraná is (mothers and sons) in scientific terms, as if viewing their own culture from the outside (i.e. assuming what would be an etic perspective of the Sateré-Mawé but an emic perspective of the scientists ) . Other statements use concepts such as agroecology, permaculture, genetic diversity, etc. (the emic perspective of the scientist) to explain how the Sateré-Mawé's own ideas about what good guarana is (the emic perspective of the Sateré-Mawé) relate to conservation and management outcomes.
As mentioned earlier (Section 2.2.1 ) , some affirmations found in the protocol regarding the status of the spontaneous guarana seedlings found in the forest or the gene flows maintained between the forest ‘mothers’ and the transplanted ‘sons’ might raise questions among ecologists. From an ecological perspective, transplanting self-recruiting seedlings into swidden cultivation probably maintains gene flows between the transplanted populations and the forest | 9
People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON populations, thus ensuring a reasonable genetic diversity within the swiddens. Nevertheless, further analysis of these gene flows remains necessary to affirm that cross-pollination between these populations can effectively occur, since the distances between the spontaneous populations in the forest and the swiddens are often considerable ( several kilometres ) . Our point here, however, is to underline the capacity of ILK to integrate and adapt to other forms and sources of knowledge.
Beyond the hybrid of forms of knowledge visible in the protocol itself, the Sateré-Mawé involved in the Waraná Project strategically use ecological facts and language to express, present or legitimate their own practices and values. We frequently observed how scientific concepts such as biodiversity, agroforestry or in situ conservation percolated in the daily discourses of producers, even reaching their Facebook posts. This discursive penetration signals the process of knowledge mixing at work, one very different from the acculturating processes that would replace traditional knowledge with generic scientific knowledge. The Sateré-Mawé use scientific concepts ( i.e. they assume an etic perspective) to translate or frame their ILK ( their emic perspective ) : this is how they legitimize it to their external counterparts.
Symmetrically, this same pluralistic approach to knowledge is sometimes drawn upon by scientists, too. For example, a team of geneticists and agronomists drew on an interpretation of the SateréMawé's foundational myth to clarify their research on the origins and domestication of guarana. Clement et al. (2010) suggest that the Sateré-Mawé myth relating the birth of guarana—and of the Sateré-Mawé people itself (see Pereira, 1954 ) —narrates in a barely metaphorical way the initial domestication of the plant by a SateréMawé woman. She noticed the particularities of the plant (i.e. its larger fruits, which are due, in scientific terms, to polyploidy ) , and, by planting the seed, began its cultivation. This ‘genetic’ re-reading of the myth, which was paired with scientific research and knowledge production about the plant's genome, led the researchers to two main conclusions. First, the species of guarana that is cultivated today is an entirely domesticated species arising from a fortuitous and unique genetic crossing. And, second, the Sateré-Mawé themselves carried out this process of domestication. .3 | From reshaping (ILK) to reclaiming (rights and traditions)
In this sub-section, we briefly present the socio-political and cultural issues that the knowledge hybridization achieved during the protocol preparation processes addressed.
From the producers' perspective, the certifications obtained are valuable in multiple ways. In addition to valorising sustainable practices on the basis of product traceability, the certifications—and the transformations of ILK they motivated—are also thought of and experienced by the producers as an opportunity to defend the integrity of their territory and to internally redefine the place of the plant in their own collective organization. .3.1 | Reclaiming the land
The demarcated Indigenous Territories remain a fragile legal construction in Brazil. While guaranteeing their indigenous inhabitants use of the land and of local resources, they face multiple pressures; among other challenges, the subsoil and its resources (such as minerals, petroleum, etc.) remain the property of the Brazilian state, and ‘projects of general interest’ (such as hydroelectric dams) can be realized upon them, independent of indigenous wishes (Baines, 2001; Brum, 2015 ) . Since the impeachment of Dilma Roussef in 2016 and Jair Bolsonaro's accession to power in 2018, the existence and integrity of Indigenous Territories have been threatened by constitutional and institutional changes invoked in a context of general deregulation (e.g. the dismantling of the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples [FUNAI ] ; Letourneau, 2019 ) . As Obadias Batista Garcia, the most prominent leader of the Waraná Project, put it 6 years ago, ‘demarcation does not mean territory (… ) . We need to produce to occupy the land’.
In this perspective, the qualification procedures underlying processes of certification emphasize the productive character of the territory and the specificity of the resources from which its production originates, and, in so doing, gives value to the most remote parts of the land. The ‘wild’ waraná gathered in the forest and transplanted into swidden agricultural fields become ‘sentries’ of the AndiráMarau indigenous land, and the ecological continuities between the forest and the swidden fields (roças) acquire value for being characteristic of sustainable agro-forestry systems. .3.2 | Reclaiming traditional practices
Among the Sateré-Mawé, certifications and labels have also prompted collective decisions to revitalize practices that had fallen into disuse, such as the building of jiraus, the use of smokers for conserving and imparting a characteristic flavour to the guarana sticks, and the intentioned combination of various plant species within guarana plantations ( Congretel, 2017 ) . Co-locating species remained a common practice until about two generations ago, when guarana shrubs were often mixed with orange or calabash trees, for example; but this traditional practice had slowly disappeared. Following the principles of analog forestry and, more broadly, principles of ecological and economic resilience, participants in the Waraná Project are now encouraged by the protocol to plant guarana together with other ‘useful species’—such as açai palm trees Euterpe oleracea, rosewood Aniba roseadora, cupuaçu Theobroma grandiflorum, andiroba or urucum—whose fruits or barks can be consumed, used or marketed.
While these practices help to restore to guarana its central place as a source of knowledge and decision-making support (Figueroa, ), they also serve many objectives more: they help to assure the sustainability of production by guaranteeing good management of the forest and diversity in the swidden fields; to differentiate the production by the Sateré-Mawé from that of their competitors and to renew the bonds of the Sateré-Mawé with the ‘epistemology of wará’. | People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON
In other words, all these practices help, by way of their interactions with guarana, to reinstall Sateré-Mawé ILK with deep significance.
Before continuing, it is important to note that the processes of knowledge production, hybridization and selection described here and captured in the protocol form part of a medium-term strategy. The codification invoked by the protocol is not intended to fix this knowledge as stable over time. It rather reflects the state of empirical and scientific knowledge at the time of its writing, as well as the position of Sateré-Mawé guarana producers in socio-political and environmental contexts likely to change more or less quickly—especially in Brazil, which, as we have seen, is in a period of especially rapid change. It is important to note, in this light, that the protocol could be reopened for discussion and revised. When we were last in the field, discussions were being held between the CPSM, ACOPIAMA and scientific partners from the National Institute for Amazonian Research ( INPA) to better understand the gene flows between forest ‘mothers’ and transplanted ‘sons’ and to debate opportunities to create a norm that would encourage producers to diversify the places from which they collect seedlings. A mid-term study of the genetic diversity of guarana plantations was planned. What is more, ILK is also a product of changing interactions between humans and non-humans, a dynamic that we examine in the next subsection. .4 | Considering the reciprocal interactions between humans and non-humans
Finally, our argument in favour of a dynamic analysis of ILK is supported by more recent work on the role of reciprocal interactions between humans and non-humans in the production of knowledge. Since the beginning of the 21st century, accounts of the material and sensory dimensions of interactions between social actors and other living things—in this case, we refer primarily to plants—appear as promising approaches for understanding the diverse forms of knowledge-making (Rose et al., 2012 ) . The thrust of such accounts is that it is necessary to recognize the agency of living things—understood broadly as all non-human beings—in their interactions with humans; in other words, researchers must attend to other beings’ capacity to act, and to make others do things, which may, in turn, transform those beings (Demeulenaere, 2017; Myers, 2015; Tsing, 2015 ) . Focusing on the categories used to think about living things is not enough to clarify these interactions.
As explained before, for the Sateré-Mawé, the waraná is a tuxaua. Thus beyond its energizing effects, the plant intervenes actively in people's social lives. Through its characteristics and attributes—that is, because the seeds contain wará and do so only if the seedling was born from a forest ‘mother’—it directs production practices. In this way, the plant is not simply a passive object of management and consumption. It can also be seen as actively doing something within or to Sateré-Mawé society and to the global world beyond: by agreeing on how to manage and cultivate guarana, the Sateré-Mawé conserve the species, the forest and other species. At the same time, the guarana conserved in this way permits the Sateré-Mawé, via designated rituals, to live as a society and to make collective decisions, including decisions to respect forage-based cultivation practices and to continue to develop and transmit the ILK associated with these practices (through the Waraná Project, for example ) . The plant is thus not passive but understood as actively contributing to and making possible social rituals and processes, including ones with conservation outcomes. According to Obadias Batista Garcia, the main leader of the Waraná Project, the project itself embodies the prophecy found in the founding myth of the Sateré-Mawé, according to which waraná would 1 day save their people.
Throughout this second section, we have seen how the interactions that the Sateré-Mawé maintain with the wider world (embodied in public policies, conventions, alliances and market transactions) and the resources they use to occupy the political and commercial arenas opened by globalization, act to transform their ecological knowledge, practices and discourses. The particular case of the Waraná Project shows the multidimensional and multifunctional character of local knowledge, including its ecological and political roles. This leads us to affirm once more that anthropologists must no longer simply inventory local phenomena but rather examine local–global interactions and come to understand their consequences and outcomes (Tsing, ). How have we proceeded methodologically to characterize such interactions? This is the matter we address in Section 4. | FOR A SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY OF LIVING PLANTS: THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PROPOSITIONS
Two complementary and interwoven methodological approaches for understanding the interactive nature of local knowledge production follow from our enlarged framing of ILK. The first (Section 4.1 ) , sociology's pragmatic approach, emphasizes the plurality of actors and scales and the links that are created among them. The second ( Section 4.2 ) , which consists of combining approaches from ethnobiology and science and technology studies (STS ) , proves helpful for illuminating how elements of knowledge produced in diverse contexts can be usefully translated or combined. At the crossroads of these two methodological entry points, we formulate an original proposal that consists of characterising knowledge creation through the description of ontologies—here, plant ontologies—to be understood as performative discourses about what is and ought to be (Section 4.3 ) . Together, these methodological and theoretical proposals constitute what we call a ‘social anthropology of living things’. .1 | The pragmatic approach
The pragmatic approach, first developed by French sociologists in the 1980s, starts with an understanding of the experience of actors. Its methods emphasize the observation of the micro-social phenomena evolved in small social groups (i.e. a nuanced, qualitative observation of the groups’ interactions) that aims to understand how | 11
People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON they participate in ‘macro-social’ phenomena (such as the organization of global value chains; Barthe et al., 2013; Chateauraynaud & Debaz, 2017 ) . Using this approach means analysing, through localized or multi-sited case studies, how collectives, groups and structures are formed (Barthe et al., 2013 ) . Another important aspect of the pragmatic approach is that it does not pretend to explain the situations observed by resorting to ways of thinking or conceptual frameworks of which the actors are not themselves aware. It rather consists of trying to understand on their own terms the discourses and justifications actors produce about their own practices ( Boltanski & Thevenot, 1991 ) . In other words, actors’ claims about their situations, beliefs, practices and so on, are taken seriously. Thus, the claim of the Sateré-Mawé that the waraná is a tuxaua is treated in the same way as the claim that waraná is a family of semidomestic rootstocks and wild lianas interacting via gene flows.
Following a pragmatic approach has significant implications for the way that inquiries are conducted, data are collected and social orders are explored. Our approach, inductive (Guillemette, 2006) and multi-sited (Marcus, 1995 ) , was based on the accumulation and progressive interpretation of data that allowed for the emergence of new questions, new key actors and new orientations for the study as the research evolved. In this respect, the pragmatic approach may bring into play what Dodier and Baszanger (1997) call ‘combinatorial ethnographies’, ethnographies that consist of noticing certain social operations (doing science, evaluating, caring, killing, etc.) observed in different contexts. In other words, rather than a controlled comparison between two objects of similar status, this approach focuses on the heterogeneity of places, objects and projects. It proves especially fruitful for helping to grasp the transformations, convergences and processes of legitimation or marginalization at play.
In the case of our study, adopting a pragmatic approach and using combinatorial ethnographies led us to observe how the plant interacts not only with indigenous communities but also with local peasants, national development agencies and implicated multinational companies (such as Coca-Cola ) . The goal was to characterize the innovative social and territorial dynamics at play around the plant in the Lower Amazonas. Instead of simply comparing how guarana is produced within the studied projects and what knowledge about the plant predominates—which would have taken for granted what guarana is to the actors invested in these projects—we observed and described ethnographically the joint trajectories of the projects and the plant along with the circulations and interactions between them and the knowledge production and transformation involved. Thus, we were able to observe that the guarana produced and experienced by the actors of the different projects is not the same plant. This is what the notion of plant ontology, presented below, intends to account for. .2 | Crossing ethnobiology with science and technology studies
Following a pragmatic approach to local knowledge and know-how relating to plants implies considering how these forms of knowledge are based upon certain capacities and powers specific to the plant in question. But how can we concretely consider the production of these forms of knowledge prior to the production of the discourses designed to make them visible and circulating? We propose to briefly review what ethnobotany (as a branch of ethnobiology dedicated to human-plant relations) can bring to this question and then to show how the descriptive and agnostic approach to human–non-human interactions provided by STS can efficiently extend the contributions of ethnobotany.
The combination of ethnobotanical and STS approaches allows us to understand the processes by which ILK is reformulated at the local–global interface. At the same time, it is important to integrate the technical and ecological aspects that feed into these processes and the ways in which networks of actors connect with one another to carry out this reformulation, and we take care to incorporate these considerations in our combined approach. .2.1 | What is revealed by ethnobotanical studies
Variants of the ethnobiological approach (Barrau, 1976; Conklin, ; Hunn, 2000 ) , as it has been conceived of since the 1950s on both sides of the Atlantic, are well known to those who study the so-called ‘traditional’ societies. Such approaches aim to inventory the patrimony of knowledge and know-how related to natural entities and resources by focusing ‘primarily on the way in which ( these societies) describe, name, class, interpret, etc., natural objects’ (Metailie & Roussel, 1998 ) . The principal merit of this approach is that it focuses on the differences between Western and non-Western ways of thinking, a focus important in contemporary anthropology.
Ethnobotany, defined in a broad sense as the ‘dynamic, evolving, and historical [study of] the relations of a human group with its plant environment’ (Haudricourt, 1956 ) , is based on the ethnography of social facts relative to plants (Lieutaghi, 2003 ) . From its roots—in progressive tropical agronomy, on the one hand ( Portères, 1961 ) , and American ethnoscience and anthropology ( Bahuchet & Lizet, 2003 ) , on the other—ethnobotany has inherited a double aim. For some, it is the privileged approach for learning more about plants themselves, a strategy with the utilitarian aim of imagining future applications. For others, its objective is anthropological (Lieutaghi, 2008 ) . In both cases, the method consists of carrying out an ethnography of the knowledge, practices and local uses or cosmologies involving plants.
One of the fundamental contributions of ethnobotany is to provide an insight into the categories used locally to think about plants, along with what these modes of thinking reveal about the place, roles and status of plants within the set of beings that populate the studied groups’ worlds. For example, ethnobotanical approaches have allowed us to understand how guarana seedlings change status when they are collected in the forest and then replanted in agricultural swiddens by the Sateré-Mawé: they pass from the category ‘hentyri’ (‘things that grow by themselves’) to | People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON the category ‘mikoi’ (‘things planted intentionally’ ) . This change of status based in the plant's semi-domestication then becomes the basis for discourses used in the protocol to highlight the contribution of Sateré-Mawé guarana management practices to the maintenance of ‘genetic diversity’.
The principal obstacle that classic ethnobiological studies must surmount is their risk of presenting a particular relationship with nature, or a particular body of ILK, as an undisputed and unchanging fact. For us, the appeal of an ethnobotanical method is that it resides less in taking an inventory of knowledge and categories and more in understanding in the processes that make them relevant to discourses destined for the ‘outside world’ ( Carneiro da Cunha, 2010 ) . From this perspective, and based on the observation that local knowledge constantly circulates, transforms and is open to multiple forms of rationality, we have sought to identify the shifts, correspondences or translations used, and reconfiguration strategies that characterize ILK in its evolving forms.
If ethnobotany is well equipped for creating inventories, it is less well equipped to answer questions about social transformations (such as, e.g. understanding how and why historically marginalized actors do or do not take advantage of particular tools and discourses or form alliances with other actors ) . To continue the previous example, it proves more interesting for the members of the Waraná Project to emphasize the genetic diversity created or maintained by their practice (using the notion of ‘semi-domestication’ to translate it into externally acceptable language) than to justify their argument on the basis that they are the community responsible for the domestication of guarana.13 To overcome this problem, we believe it is necessary to go beyond making inventories of local knowledge and its categorization and to situate them more robustly in their evolving environmental and political contexts so as to understand the dynamics of knowledge alteration and re-elaboration. Only by understanding these dynamics can we understand how ILK contributes to conservation and management in a changing world.
In this perspective, combining ethnobotany with methods from science and technology studies may be fruitful. With a composite approach, it becomes possible to characterize the cognitive, technical, sensory, interactive, temporal and strategic experiences of people in relation to the plant. .2.2 | The contribution of STS
Developed by Anglo-American researchers (Bloor, 1983; Collins, 1985; Jasanoff, Markle, Petersen, & Pinch, 1995) and present in France since the 1980s, science and technology studies approach science as a practice that is historical, social and technical. Its basis lies in making a close ethnographic description of its subjects, human and non-human, and of their interactions in the processes of ‘making’ science and technology. STS can be divided into several different lines of work, and, over the past several decades, it has produced a number of impactive theories. The actor-network theory (ANT ) , which we focus on here, is one of them. Developed mainly by M. Callon, B. Latour, J. Law and M. Akrich, ANT emphasizes the multiplicity and heterogeneity of agents implicated in doing science. It gives particular importance to the role that objects play in the production, interpretation and circulation of the data that ‘makes’ scientific knowledge and disseminates this knowledge within the wider society (Callon, 1984; Latour, 1989; Law, 1987 ) .
Though ANT intends to describe ‘science as it is being made’ by foregrounding aspects of methodology that scientists themselves rarely include in their scientific publications, the approach can be applied productively in the study of ILK by focusing on the frequently ignored aspects of its development. Fieldwork takes the form of observing the multiple interactions—between social actors, between humans and other beings (plants in our case) or between multiple other beings themselves (plants, technical objects, etc. ) — that contribute to the production of different forms of knowledge. We can then describe the translations that operate in the ‘creation of knowledge’ through these interactions. In STS, the idea of translation designates the displacement of an entity (an object, phenomenon or technique) from one environment (spatio-temporal, linguistic, disciplinary, etc.) to another in response to a particular problem (Callon, 1984 ) . Translation should thus be understood as a process through which elements that are a priori incommensurable ( such as plant, space, chemical input, productivity figure or parasite) are brought into relation. This state of relations is always susceptible to change and is never entirely stabilized. The protocol of production written by the Sateré-Mawé is from this point of view exemplary, as we will see.
Some authors have criticized ANT, faulting it for an ‘undifferentiated conception of social spaces' (Bonneuil & Thomas, 2009, p. 13 ) . According to these critics, ANT gives too little importance to the context and the social positions of actors, leading to a situation in which ‘the sociohistoric specificities of each account tend to be toned down’ (Aggeri & Hatchuel, 2003, p. 117 ) . Our methodological proposition allows us to avoid this pitfall. Using ‘combinatorial ethnographies’ to join the ANT approach with ethnobiological and micro-sociological surveys—which include the collection of life stories, project stories and argumentations, as we did with the actors involved in the Waraná Project—a holistic set of interactions that contribute to knowledge formation between the Sateré-Mawé and other entities can be taken into account. At the same time, this combination of approaches prevents us from neglecting the particularities of each actor or group of actors, be they cosmological, spiritual, political or historical ones ( see Congretel, 2017 ) . .3 | Describing the ontologies of plants
Our proposal to approach plant-related ILK by describing the ontologies of plants arises from the two methodological approaches presented and embodies the need to take into account the agency of non-humans—here, in the production of knowledge. Ecologists | 13
People and Nature
CONGRETEL aNd PINTON think of species as agentive, functional entities within dynamic ecosystems or socio-ecosystems, yet it is not always clear how to understand or represent their ability to do things—and in particular to make people do things. Neither it is clear how to evaluate the dynamic interactions between species, the environment and humans. We want to emphasize that knowledge derived from a plant–human interaction can also be influenced by what ecologists call the developmental or functional traits of plants (in other words, by the ‘other’ powers held by plants ) . For example, the structure of guarana's genome makes it behave a certain way in a certain environmental condition, and this contributes to the production of knowledge related to its cultivation. Another example is the wará contained in waraná seeds, which brings thoughts and knowledge to those who consume it.
The way in which we understand and mobilize the notion of ontology is mostly inspired by researches in STS (Law & Lien, 2013; Mol, 1999) and biological philosophy (Dupre, 2012 ) . In its most literal sense, ontology is ‘a discourse on what is’ (Pellizzoni, )—in the case of guarana, a discourse on what ‘good guarana’ is and ought to be. Our understanding of ontology goes beyond this to consider ontology as a performative discourse, a way of talking about guarana that guides the practices of those who use it, practices which in turn modify or (re- ) ’create’ guarana. Thus, the guarana with which the Sateré-Mawé interact—waraná—is not the same as the one that is manipulated in laboratories. Nor is it the same as the one grown by caboclo smallholders. In other words, we want to avoid the danger of merely studying others’ representations of what we ‘know the world to be’ and instead to recognize and describe other worlds revolving around common objects—here, a plant (Demeulenaere, 2017; Henare, Holbraad, & Wastell, 2007 ) .
To characterize these ontologies is thus to characterize the set of discourses about and practices with living things. Our aim is to reveal, by analysing the relations of different social groups to the same ‘living object’, a pluralism of ways in which ‘what is’ and ‘what ought to be’ that emerges. This approach can also clarify the tensions between groups or groups’ strategic capacity to pass from one ontology to another according to the context in which they express themselves.
In the protocol, the definitions and instructions that appear are based on scientific knowledge and vocabulary but retain their associations with traditional knowledge and values (mythology ) . Drawing on what the project members have validated as their traditional ontology of guarana, and on the practices of production that they wish to conserve or reintroduce, the protocol performs a translation—in the STS sense—into ecological terms, thus making visible an ‘ecological ontology’ of waraná. This translation allows the actors in the project to operate within the field of environmentalist discourse and to discuss ‘in equal registers of knowledge’ with their ecologist partners—and also with the promoters of agricultural modernization whom the Sateré-Mawé resist. The chart below illustrates this point by comparing some characteristics of the two waraná ontologies mobilized by the project members, which we refer to here as ‘traditional waraná’ and ‘ecological waraná’, the translation of traditional into ecological terms. Both ontologies can be opposed to a third that we have identified as ‘improved guarana’ (Table 1 ) .
If man's relation to nature is mediated by a complex set of representations (Dugast, 2003 ) , characterizing these ontologies helps us understand what they tell us about the positioning of the project members, their ambitions and their relations to others and to the globalized world. Thus, rather than proposing a counter-narrative based on their cosmology or their identity as ‘children of waraná’, the Sateré-Mawé propose arguments of a scientific nature that emphasize the ecological and sustainable character of their practices. This translation, reflecting the alignment of their discourse, practices and objectives, legitimates their traditional practices but also their occupation of their territory, which becomes a unique ‘reserve’ of biodiversity. | CONCLUSIONS
The renewal of research on indigenous and local knowledge following the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (or CBD ) , the general criticisms of the productivist model of conventional agriculture, and the many different trajectories of agriculture today have led to a diversity of knowledge that calls into question the monopoly of science (Agrawal, 1995; Compagnone, Lamine, & Dupre, 2018; Ingram, ; Kloppenburg Jr., 1991 ) . The integration of these ‘knowledges’ into environmentalist discourse has enabled a recognition of ‘situated knowledges’—that is, a plurality of localized, evolving forms of knowledge—each guided by interactions with the natural environment; such knowledges are in distinct contrast to the ‘ungrounded’ knowledge of science and its claims of universality. The approach proposed TA B LE 1 Comparison of the characteristics of two different ontologies of guarana: traditional waraná and ecological waraná ( translation)

CONGRETEL aNd PINTON in this paper allows us to follow the trajectories and transformations between these different knowledges, and our analysis of the knowledge reconfiguration processes underlying the Waraná Project emphasizes the need to consider ILK's functions, sources of inspiration and modes of acquisition to better understand its relevance.
The XVI Congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology, held in Belém, Brazil, in August 2018, made its objective a stock-taking of 30 years of public policies and social mobilizations that had aimed to take indigenous and local knowledge into account in conservation decision-making processes. However, few changes are evident on the ground, and the knowledge of indigenous populations is often immediately discarded as non-actionable for its distance from westerns standards of conservation. If ILK is not yet broadly seen as contributing to conservation actions, we suggest that this is because ILK is too often misunderstood by researchers and managers as a historical body of knowledge about strictly local phenomena (e.g. as an inventory of species names and culturally specific uses ) . Clearly, such a body of knowledge, though it can easily be made to look like facts or data, would not be something useful for a changing world in which the local is linked to the global, and where multiple forms of knowledge and cultural contexts vie for influence in lengthy value chains. Our methodology allows us to see how ILK is transformed locally and to appreciate some strategies that it uses to resolve conservation problems.
The case of the Sateré-Mawé is exemplary in this sense, insofar as they have been able to find solid support outside their community and have benefited from leaders determined to defend their culture, their practices and to reinforce their capabilities (Sen, 2010 ) . Their goal is to have Sateré-Mawé ILK recognized by the external world as meaningful, and the successful strategy they have used lies in the creation of equivalences and comparisons between their ILK and scientific knowledge. This has implied the formation of strong partnerships in the field and mediations with ecologists and conservationists. To understand these ‘translations’, we moved on different scales and in the different places where knowledge is being developed, from indigenous territory to the globalized public space of ecological crisis, without neglecting regional and national spaces. The networking of actors involved in the Waraná Project made it possible to link all these together.
The Sateré-Mawé thus respond to the question famously formulated by Latour (2017 ) : how is it possible to anchor locally to inhabit the world? This scalar issue adds complexity and heterogeneity to the observed processes; in the case of Brazil, for example, the federal institutions responsible for processing the certification files submitted by the CPSM can considerably slow down the procedures and put applicants in difficulty.
Our propositions are not new in that they have already been used, here and there, in the literature. They are not stricto sensu specific to ‘traditional knowledge’ or to ILK and the problematics that concern them (such as status, rights and situations ) . Nevertheless, they do open the scope of research more generally to the creation of singular, local, situated knowledge, and towards an understanding of how local, participatory processes have brought global ecological discourse into dialogue with ILK. Practicing a social anthropology of living beings, focused on plant ontologies, is a way to understand the plurality of worlds engaged in the production of knowledge, and to understand how the dynamic encounter between these worlds can benefit the conservation of both biological and cultural diversity.
The production of local knowledge may bring together a multitude of micro-worlds at the dynamic interface of the local and the global (Chateauraynaud & Debaz, 2017; Tsing, 2015 ) . Working with ILK in this context is a challenge. The challenge is political in the sense of understanding the diversity of local and/or territorial responses to global social and ecological crises, as they contribute to the political reconfiguration of the world. And it is scientific as it demands a complex methodological arsenal associating anthropological approaches with a pragmatic sociology.

Abstract . Ample evidence suggests positive effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning and services in natural and agricultural landscapes. Less obvious and even contested are the effects of such diversity on human well- being. This state of art partly stems from methodological difficulties to evaluate and quantify these effects and imprecise conceptual frameworks. . Here we propose a conceptual framework that links different aspects of diversity, particularly species and genetic richness, to ecosystem functioning, ecosystem services and disservices, and different aspects of well- being. We review current approaches for the study of diversity– well- being relationships and identify shortcomings and principle obstacles, mainly stemming from theoretical premises that are too imprecise. . We discuss five basic methodological approaches to link diversity to well- being: matrix models, indirect inference, Price partitioning, structural equation modelling, and environmental inference. . We call for a stricter terminology with respect to the different aspects of functioning, multifunctionality and well- being and highlight the need to evaluate each step in the different pathways from diversity to well- being. A full understanding of ecological constraints on human well- being requires consideration of trade- offs in diversity effects, of contrasting perceptions of well- being, and of ecosystem disservices.

During the past 30 years, ecologists have amounted strong evidence that, on average, more diverse, that means more species rich, natural ecosystems and those modified by humans are functionally and compositionally more stable (e.g. Loreau & de Mazancourt, 2013; Tilman et al., 2006 ) , resilient (e.g. Dell et al., 2019; Elmqvist et al., 2003 ) , and robust against disturbances (e.g. MacDougall et al., 2013 ) . Theoretical and empirical evidence predicts that high taxonomical and functional diversity particularly increase energy transfer (Barnes et al., 2018; Buzhdygan et al., 2020 ) , nutrient cycling (Roscher et al., 2004 ) , production (Hector et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2018) and food web stability (Zhao et al., 2019) and, consequently, ecosystem functioning (Hooper et al., 2005; Weisser et al., 2017 ) .
Closely related to ecological functionality is the widely used concept of ecosystem services (Daily et al., 1997) stemming from the notion that part of these ecosystem functions supported by biodiversity directly benefits human well- being, particularly human health (Lee et al., 2021; MA, 2005; WHO, 2015 ) . Human well- being is a very broad concept that has been used interchangeable with personal happiness, quality of life and health, but also more generally with human welfare, intact social bonds and human rights (Clark, 2014 ) . Some of these concepts are difficult to quantify and therefore might not allow for a projection onto environmental diversity. Therefore, we here follow Summers et al. (2012) and refer to physical, mental and cultural wellbeing including four quantifiable elements: basic needs, economic needs, environmental needs and subjective happiness. Intuitively, these elements should require a natural and productive environment. Consequently, we focus on agriculturally modified landscapes.
Important directly quantifiable ecosystem services include food production, air and water cleaning, water retention, carbon sequestration, climate regulation and soil fertility (Brondizio et al., 2019; Daily et al., 1997; Montanarella et al., 2018 ) . Less apparent but not less important are, for instance, pest control, delivery of genetic material and medically important secondary metabolites, pollination, natural nutrient supply, stabilization of the immune system or pedogenesis (de Groot et al., 2002; Rook, 2013 ) . Consequently, several authors have made a causal link between diversity, ecological functioning, ecosystem services and human well- being, the latter including health status (e.g. Aerts et al., 2018; Kilpatrick et al., 2017; Lovell et al., 2014; MA, 2005; Methorst et al., 2021 ) . The WHO report (WHO, 2015) and Marselle et al. (2019, 2021) have reviewed the state of the art and outlined general frameworks and study directions linking some of these aspects.
Increasing work has been devoted to cultural ecosystem services and human well- being (reviewed in Jax et al., 2018 and Kosanic & Petzold, 2020 ) . Cultural ecosystem services refer to the nonmaterial benefits that directly influence the life quality (Plieninger et al., 2013 ) . Different classifications of these services have been proposed, but all of them highlight recreation and ecotourism, cultural heritage, education and spiritual values as being most important (e.g. Plieninger et al., 2013 ) . An assessment of these cultural ecosystem services requires a toolbox from the social science including participatory methods and accessibility assessment (Cheng et al., 2019; Crouzat et al., 2022; Montes- Pulido & Forero, 2021 ) .
The mentioned work on ecosystem services demonstrates how much of our current view about the impact of biodiversity on human well- being is still based on broad generalizations and common belief and how little we know about the strength of specific biodiversity– well- being relationships and possible trade- off between these relationships. Additionally, the question how to quantify the relationships between biodiversity and human well- being has gained too little attention (Levy et al., 2012 ) , seemingly due to spatio- temporal scale issues, as well as different ways of measuring diversity and well- being that hinder cross study comparisons and quantitative meta- analyses, making this research field still predominantly case study orientated (Aerts et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2021 ) .
Here, we aim to address this knowledge gap considering the strength of specific biodiversity– well- being relationships and possible trade- offs between then. To accomplish this goal and to overcome limitations in the analytical approaches, we focus on the need to match qualitative and quantitative approaches to relate biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and human well- being. For this purpose, we present five advanced multivariate data analytical methods. We argue that any inference of the links between diversity and human well- being needs sufficiently flexible and multidimensional modelling approaches. Bi- variate comparisons of measures of diversity and human health status appear to be less promising while not accounting for the inherent complex nature of diversity effects on ecosystem functioning and well- being. | KEY PATHWAYS FROM DIVERSITY TO ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING .1 | A conceptual framework
Rendón et al. (2019 ) , Marselle et al. (2021 ) , and de la Riva et al. (2022) previously outlined major positive effects of ecosystem functioning on humans. To quantify these effects, we need to disentangle the research platforms to gather relevant data about ecosystem functioning and well- being across space and time.

ULRICH et al. many facets of functioning but also the complex direct and indirect relationships between environmental changes and health issues. For this task, we introduce a framework that incorporates the many aspects of diversity across levels of differentiation and differentiates between constituent diversity (genes, species, guilds) and systems diversity (functional diversity, interaction network complexity) ( Figure 1 ) . Both constituent and systems diversity stabilize ecological interactions (Tilman et al., 1998) and increase system robustness and resilience (Landi et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2015 ) . In this respect, we see ecosystem multifunctionality (Manning et al., 2018) as an integrative concept over multiple important single aspects of systems diversity. In our view, the ecological multifunctionality concept lacks developed counterparts with respect to ecosystem services and the different aspects of well- being. Fagerholm et al. (2020) application of a multifunctional landscape concept to well- being might be seen as a step in this direction.
Multifunctionality refers to the ability of ecosystems to provide a multitude of functions and ecosystem services (Manning et al., 2018 ) . Within this framework supposed positive ecosystem effects on human well- being should include more than a single functional category to be conclusive (e.g. timber production, recreation, and soil formation might cause positive and negative well- being effects depending on the social perspective ) . Consequently, the different well- being and functioning categories mentioned in Figure 1 are not independent and an integrative inference would need to include the many trade- offs between these categories. In this respect, the multifunctionality concept can be seen as a holistic approach to such inference. We note that the framework outlined in Figure 1, in principle, refers also to crop plant and livestock health. While much work has been devoted to the negative impacts of livestock on diversity, the possible positive effects of diversity and multifunctionality on plant and animal health have not received sufficient attention ( Herrero et al., 2015 ) .
We assume that four major drivers of global change (change in land use, climate change, land degradation and pollution) determine constituent and systems diversity, influence the levels of productive and regulatory ecosystem functions (Brondizio et al., 2019; Díaz et al., 2018) and might directly affect human well- being (Figure 1 ) . Along these relationships we will discuss quantification issues and possible pitfalls in the assessment of biodiversity impacts on human well- being. This framework also recognizes the direct effects of environmental changes on human health, such as urbanization or pollution, not being only mediated by biodiversity (Figure 1 ) . We do not differentiate among the many aspects of human well- being as this would go far beyond the scope of the present methodology orientated revision (cf. Summers et al., 2012 ) . But we caution that we should not generalize diversity– well- being relationships and possible recommendations from single studies or from the study of single elements of well- being alone.
The ecosystem service concept includes the possibility that natural ecosystems might also provide disservices (GutierrezArellano & Mulligan, 2018; Shackleton et al., 2016 ) , including harmful organisms. Ecosystem services and disservices often covary as they are indirectly related and therefore have to be seen in terms of synergies and trade- offs with the consequence that land use may alter the strength of these relationships (Birkhofer et al., 2015, 2021) and that intact ecosystems might not only have a positive effect on human well- being. Current reviews on ecosystem services have not fully recognized these trade- offs (Marselle et al., 2021; Rendón et al., 2019 ) . Any assessment of diversity– well- being relationships needs first to account for individual positive and negative relationships and then to quantify the resulting net effects.
It is now generally accepted that the aspects of constituent diversity are positively correlated with ecosystem productivity (Tilman et al., 2012) and element cycling (Hättenschwiler FI G U R E 1 From major drivers of environmental change to human health related well- being. , 2023, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10421 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [25/04/2023 ] .

ULRICH et al. et al., 2005) and, therefore, ecosystem integrity (Hansen et al., 2021 ) . However, the question whether systems diversity, particularly food web complexity and functional diversity, positively correlates with the various aspects of ecosystem functioning is still controversially discussed despite strong claims in favour ( e.g. Balvanera et al., 2006; Bastian, 2013 ) . For instance, Díaz et al. (2007) and Cadotte et al. (2011) demonstrated how systems diversity, particularly functional diversity and species dominances boost ecosystem functions. In turn, Sullivan et al. (2017) failed to find any correlation between functional diversity and carbon storage in tropical habitats. Based on bee flower visitation data, Kleijn et al. (2015) cautioned that pollination efficacy alone is a weak argument in favour of bee protection. Apparently, there are no universal causal relationships and case- specific relationships might vary considerably in direction depending on scale, study system, and geographic area. This calls for case specific assessments of diversity– ecosystem functioning relationships and should caution us in terms of generalizations. Consequently, any tracing of pathways from ecological functioning to human well- being needs quantifiable relationships at each stage along the chain. The starting hypothesis that diverse ecosystems increase human well- being is in fact an amalgam of several, not necessarily coherent, assumptions about causal relationships along a multitude of single dependencies that form causal chains. These chains might not always be linear but will often contain bi- or even multidirectional causal relationships. Consequently, we need appropriate modelling techniques that are able to disentangle such complex causal relationships.
Well- being as a quality of human life also needs to be precisely defined as ecosystem functioning and services do not apply to all people equally and may even cause conflicting opinions (FelipeLucia et al., 2015, 2022 ) . High expressions of provisioning ecosystem services are customer specific and the mix of these services might include a trade- off with unknown effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. For instance, the ecosystem services that soils provide in different major ecosystems (e.g. urban, agricultural, natural) may be valued very differently depending on the perception and priorities of end users. While urban citizens may prefer opportunities for soils to support construction (urban sprawl ) , farmers prioritize food production and conservation practitioners focus on the protection of biodiversity, which results in competing priorities for ecosystem service provision from the same land (Setälä et al., 2014 ) . So far, trade- offs in different dimensions of well- being have not sufficiently been studied (e.g. Lapointe et al., 2021; Santos- Martín et al., 2013, for indirect perception- based inferences ) , but may have important effects on the assessment of diversity– well- being relationships and the respective management decisions. We propose to apply the multifunctionality concept of community ecology and its associated measures (Manning et al., 2018) also to the different dimensions of well- being to obtain a coherent quantification of wellbeing across its different elements, by this accounting for possible trade- offs. | QUANTIFYING FUNCTIONALITY AND WELL- BEING .1 | Approaches to ecosystem comparisons
Diversity– well- being relationships might be studied from very different perspectives. In Figure 2, we exemplify six basic diversity– disturbance combinations and the resulting ways for comparison. For convenience, we use the term disturbance to quantify the degree to which a system deviates from being natural. Many studies have asked whether (often more diverse) natural ecosystems foster well- being more than (mainly less diverse) anthropogenic systems ( Balmford & Bond, 2005; MA, 2005; Summers et al., 2012 ) . Such an approach does not directly answer to the question of whether diversity itself improves well- being. It studies the combined effects of diversity and the degree of anthropogenic disturbance on wellbeing. In fact, this cautionary note refers to all studies that compare diversity and well- being across different types of ecosystem and also across habitats of the same type influenced by different environmental conditions. For example, anthropogenic environments of higher and lower diversity might differently impact well- being. Well- being then jointly results from a diversity effect and the effect of difference between the ecosystem types used for comparison. Consequently, we mainly assess the degree of change in land- use or FI G U R E 2 Six possible types of combinations (rectangles) of ecosystems with lower and higher diversity and degree of disturbance (naturalness) to study the impact on well- being. The impact of diversity only (diversity– well- being relationship) is best studied comparing natural ecosystems with low and high diversity. , 2023, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10421 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [25/04/2023 ] .

ULRICH et al. landscape reshaping on well- being rather than the mechanistic link between diversity and well- being (Figure 2 ) .
Comparisons of disturbed and undisturbed species rich and poor systems might be able to infer the effect of disturbance on wellbeing. This is an important task in its own right and a major issue in agricultural landscapes, where the total species richness of many taxa is still high and close to the undisturbed state despite of major changes in land use. This approach would only tell about diversity effects on well- being if we could partition the effects of species richness from the disturbance effects.
We argue that for a direct inference of diversity effects on wellbeing we need to look at ecological systems and asks whether differences in diversity of these systems differently influence ecosystem services and human well- being (Figure 2 ) . We need to combine these approaches in a multivariate analysis of diversity– disturbance– wellbeing relationships although unequivocal interpretation still might be challenging. Importantly, all these approaches have a spatial and temporal dimension and we might particularly differentiate between local and landscape scale diversity effects on well- being ( Methorst et al., 2021 ) , as well as short- and long- term effects (Qiu & Cardinale, 2020 ) . These different approaches to compare ecosystems of different diversity and disturbance levels have not always been clearly separated (e.g. Haynes- Young & Potschin, 2010; Marselle et al., 2021 ) . .2 | Statistical issues
In the environmental and also the social sciences, statistical inference is generally based on Pearson- Neyman and Bayesian frameworks. These do not test empirical hypotheses as required by classical models of scientific inference (Kuhn, 1966) but try to reject theoretical constructs (the null assumptions or statistical standards) in favour of our hypotheses (Lehman & Romano, 2005 ) . These approaches work well for simple cause– effect relationships with intermediate numbers of samples. However, today's ecological, medical and sociological datasets often contain thousands or even tens of thousands of single data, allowing for more than one possible statistical standard, and cover complex variable relationships. At such sample sizes and levels of complexity classical statistical inference with associated significance levels break down while too often pointing to high significance although in fact not having any real impact (Burnham & Anderson, 2002; Lehman & Romano, 2005; van der Laan & Hsu, 2010 ) . Reliance on significance levels only might heavily bias our impression on the relative importance of different wellbeing drivers when using the results of meta- analytical studies. It has consequences for the detection of the influences of diversity and ecosystem functions on human well- being. Therefore, we emphasize the need to rely on effect sizes instead of significances to quantify relationships. In most cases these will be estimates of the proportion of explained variability in the response variable. Importantly, we use the term ‘quantitative’ in a broad sense as any quantitative approach might also cover qualitative inference using appropriately coded categories of well- being and ecological functioning (e.g. positive versus negative effects or answers in participatory research ) .
Below, we discuss methods for the assessment of diversity– well- being relationships and present five approaches suited to deal with quantitative and appropriately coded qualitative data. These approaches include structural equation modelling of the drivers of well- being, matrix models to link sets of variables, price partitioning for the study of temporal or spatial change in functioning, the integrative analysis of multiple ecosystem functions, and environmental modelling. We choose these methods from the multitude of available statistical tools as each of them tackles a different question based on specific data structures relevant to the functional diversity- human well- being relationships. In this respect, they can be seen as being complementary. We do not claim this set of approaches to be exhaustive. Our choice was guided by the potential for broad application in combination with ecological, economic and sociological data. .3 | Assessing diversity– well- being relationship
The detection of biodiversity effects on human well- being must not rely on a simple bivariate analysis (Figure 1 ) . Diversity is mediated by consecutive steps of influence and any appropriate analysis of these influences needs to account for a chain of relationships, where each step has to be quantified appropriately. In Figure 3, we develop a respective framework and indicate important single steps of this chain with respective examples of quantification. Ideally, these steps should be applied in the comparisons outlined in Figure 2 and can be simplified to environment ↔ diversity ↔ community functioning ↔ ecosystem services ↔ well- being, where the double arrows indicate possible mutual relationships. We note that in many cases not all data of Figure 3 will be available at the cost of reduced power of the argument regarding diversity– well- being effects.
The shortest way from local species diversity to human wellbeing is a three- step pathway and includes community functioning and important ecosystem services like water and soil purification and formation (Figure 3 ) . Therefore, this chain appears to be most promising for any respective inference. Other analyses are more indirect and include community functioning steps, and either ecosystem services or plant and animal well- being (Figure 3 ) . In all cases, we might wish to account for landscape structure, land use, and, casually, ecological history to proper assess the focal diversity status.
Diversity might be related directly to a focal aspect of human health in a bivariate comparison. For instance, Methorst et al. (2021) used bivariate regressions to link diversity and environmental characteristics to measures of human well- being and found particularly bird species richness and recreation access to correlate positively with well- being. In a participatory study, Bryce et al. (2016) used questionnaires to directly relate biodiversity to cultural well- being. However, it remains unclear, as cautioned by the authors themselves, whether bird richness was the ultimate cause of well- being or only a proximate reason influenced by some hidden general factor such , 2023, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10421 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [25/04/2023 ] .

ULRICH et al. as the availability of green spaces or fresh air. This case study highlights some difficulties particularly with the assessment of cultural well- being, not only when based on participatory studies. Similarly, Hummel et al. (2019) drew attention to the difficulties in applying ecosystem service concepts to protected areas. Hidden factors and traditions might also bias the results. For instance, in a recent participatory assessment of cultural well- being and forest conservation Nzau et al. (2022) showed how tradition and social status differently influence the perception of ecosystem values of Kenyan rural people. Further, correlative inferences do not inform us about causal relationships as a number of covariates listed in Figures 1 and might influence both variables in unknown ways, both in identical or opposite directions. We would need to compare a manifold of single bivariate patterns or multiple partial analyses obtained in different configurations of habitat and ecosystem functioning to rule out these covariates. These data might stem from controlled experiments, empirical samples or participatory studies.
Inference of the diversity– well- being relationship might be conducted by a correlative approach including linear or nonlinear additive models (general linear models glm, ANOVA, generalized additive models gam; Zuur et al., 2009 ) . These approaches have apparent or hidden shortcomings. An apparent point of caution is the equiprobable random standard most regression models are based on. Even when using non- normal error distributions, the null assumption for independence implies zero covariance and regression slope. These expectations are in many ecologically realistic situations not justified making inference of statistical significance of the model parameters questionable. A well- known example involves two variables, where one is constraint by the second (Nee et al., 2005 ) . In this case both variables, even if being independent random numbers, will positively correlate. With respect to ecosystem functioning measures, we might imagine a food web of several trophic levels, where the abundances and therefore also the diversity of higher levels are constrained by the abundances in the lower levels. In this case, the proper null assumption of non- independence will be a function of the degree of constrain. Furthermore, measurement method might determine the type of constraint and thus influence our statistical inference. If human and animal/plant well- being are quantified by similar metrics, one metric might have values that are always within the second one. In this case both automatically become positively correlated. Standard regression analysis will return inflated levels of significance for the positive relationship between both variables and therefore erroneously assess the impact of animal/plant well- being on human health.
The pathway from diversity to human well- being contains apparent and possible latent variables, the latter in the form of covariates to each of the factors shown in Figures 1 and 2. The covariates include human influences on each of the steps and therefore causal loops as well as inherent constraints on each variable. For instance, human well- being has an impact on animal health and ecosystem functioning (Naeem et al., 2009 ) . The level of ecosystem functioning impacts local diversity, which is related to human health ( Newbold et al., 2019 ) . These causal loops make any application of one- directional linear modelling like glm, gam, or matrix models less interpretable than it seems. Therefore, we argue in favour of statistical models that are able to handle such bidirectional dependencies. Particularly, different path analytical approaches are able to evaluate the likelihood of causal pathways.
In both, bi- and multivariate regression approaches, high sample sizes inevitably increase type II error levels (Burnham & Anderson, 2002 ) .

ULRICH et al. degrees of freedom would need more than 500 single and independent data points (50 for each degree of freedom) for the detection of at least moderate effect sizes (Zuur et al., 2009 ) . To support the argument of positive effects of high diversity on health, the regression analysis would need to be significant at each of the five steps. Importantly, effect sizes (EF) of such a chain act multiplicatively. Therefore, in case of average moderate single effect sizes of, for instance, 50% the final estimate for the impact of diversity on human well- being will be EF = 0.55 = 0.03 ≡ 3%. For the three- step chain we reach in a final EF = 0.53 = 0.13 ≡ 13%. In any case, we need to have a manifold of independent studies to corroborate the hypothesis of a positive impact of diversity on human well- being. .4 | A matrix approach to inference
In community ecology multiple matrix approaches for assessing community assembly from information on species traits, phylogenetic relatedness, interaction dynamics, and environmental filtering are well introduced (Dray & Legendre, 2008; ter Braak, 2017; Ulrich et al., 2018 ) . Fourth corner and related correspondence analytical tools allow for a direct mapping of species traits on environmental data via a link matrix, typically containing species abundances, presence– absence biomass data (Dolédec et al., 1996 ) , or weighing factors like species interaction strength (Ulrich et al., 2014 ) . In Figure 4, we propose a multiple matrix approach to the study of the diversity— well- being relationship with entry data able to parameterize the analytical steps identified in Figure 3. Importantly, any qualitative or quantitative (coded) data might be used as matrix entries.
Fourth corner statistics use inner matrix multiplication to link a species × trait matrix T with an environmental variable × site matrix via a species × site link matrix M. In the present case this might be a matrix containing aspects of human well- being (Figure 4 ) . The result is a trait × aspect matrix where entries are respective effect sizes (correlations in cases of Z- transformed values and a presence– absence link matrix) of the dependences of trait expression and well- being. Statistical testing comes from appropriate randomization approaches. We note that in case of linear relationships and an abundance matrix M the inner product TTM provides total trait expressions at each site (Figure 4 ) , from which we can calculate the site specific degrees of multifunctionality (Manning et al., 2018 ) . Unfortunately, individual trait expressions tend to vary across sites in dependences on environmental factors and on species interactions making direct inferences of ecosystem functioning and trait– well- being correlations challenging (de Bello et al., 2011 ) . Therefore, we will often need habitat specific link functions for the trait– environment relationship (Figure 4 ) . This step seems to be crucial as intraspecific trait variability and nonlinear environmental trait scaling might heavily influence estimates of ecosystem functioning and multifunctionality (Des Roches et al., 2018; Wong & FI G U R E 4 A matrix model to exemplify the data necessary for a proposed analysis of the diversity well- being relationship: three species ( a– e) based matrices: (a) species × traits, (b) species × functioning weights across sites, (c) species × group membership across sites and a matrix containing values of different aspects of human well- being across study sites. Species trait expression is generally depending on the environment and therefore needs a link function f ( .) to be linked to functioning weights. Matrix operations allow for estimations of functionality and ecosystem service values. , 2023, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10421 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [25/04/2023 ] .

ULRICH et al.
Carmona, 2021 ) . Recently, Sarker et al. (2021) demonstrated the validity of this approach comparing a variety of nonlinear link functions and models to calculate mangrove primary production from variable tree trait expressions. Similar approaches should be used to assess ecosystem service values from trait compositions (Figure 4 ) . The resulting function values might then be correlated with some quantification of human well- being, if appropriate again using link functions ( Manning et al., 2018 ) .
In a different approach we might wish to define ecological groups or functional guild using a matrix of guild membership when linking traits with functioning weights (for instance, abundance or biomass values ) . Combined with respective link functions (weights) as before this approach provides function values and ecosystem service contributions for focal groups/guilds. This allows for an assessment of the contribution of these groups/guilds to observed human wellbeing levels (Figure 4 ) . .5 | Price partitioning
Despite recent critiques (Pillai & Gouhier, 2019; van Veelen, 2020) a promising approach to link changes in well- being to diversity measured by species richness or functional diversity implies the use of price partitioning. The price equation of evolutionary biology applied to ecological communities (Fox, 2006; Loreau & Hector, 2001) states that the total change in some character value in a community might be partitioned into additive parts containing the contribution of community diversity and the covariance of trait values and composition. Ulrich et al. (2022) introduced a new partition that includes also the effects of changes in total community abundances. When applied to the change in the value of a focal community function or of an ecosystem service this partitioning can be simplified into a three- partition solution (Ulrich et al., 2022) where a and b are normalizing constants and ΔF, ΔS, ΔN denote the changes in the total functioning value F, the species richness S and total abundance N between two communities A and B. wA, Δp and FA refer to the arithmetic mean of the functioning weights of the species in A (the trait values ) , the mean change in relative trait abundance p and the average value of functioning in A. Therefore, this approach allows for a simple decomposition of richness, and compositional and abundance effects on ecosystem functioning. The quotient wA Δ S
Δ F quantifies the relative impact of species richness on the change in functionality or ecosystem service. In a next analytical step, the decomposed differences in functioning between pairs of study sites might be related to respective differences in well- being leading to two dissimilarity matrices that can be linked by bi- or multivariate matrix regression. This approach appears to be particularly promising as it bypasses the functionality step in an elegant way. .6 | Structural equation modelling
Direct bivariate correlations are descriptive as they do not inform about causal relationships. Although structural equation modelling SEM (path analysis) is also based on linear correlations the complex model structure, including hidden (latent) variables, provides at least hypotheses about such causal dependencies ( Kline, 2016; Shipley, 2016 ) . Ideally, the relationships identified in Figure 3 form a basic path analytical network that can be simplified into models of latent and hidden variables dependent on data availability. Path analytical approaches are data hungry and only a few studies have used these models for inferences of ecosystem functioning (Mardani et al., 2017 ) . The potential of this approach is still not fully realized. Traditionally, SEMs are used to infer human influences on diversity and ecosystem functioning (e.g. McKinney et al., 2010; Schweiger et al., 2016 ) . Often the results can be interpreted as a negative relationship between diversity and human well- being. From a complex path model including direct and indirect biodiversity drivers of human well- being Santos- Martín et al. (2013) inferred positive effects of biodiversity on well- being mediated by regulating ecosystem services and negative effects when mediated by provisioning ecosystem services. These contrasting results exemplify the methodological and conceptional difficulties when linking diversity and human well- being. These difficulties are often downplayed in current conceptual reviews of the state of the art (e.g. Naeem et al., 2016 ) .
In this respect, particularly partial least squares path analysis ( PLS PM) with its bootstrapped- based extensions appeared as a promising tool in the field of ecology and human well- being despite the fact that it is mainly applied in social and chemical sciences, so far. Despite current discussion about the validity of the model (e.g. Rönkkö et al., 2016) PLS PM has proven to be an appropriate tool to explore the functioning of complex systems involving highly correlated predictors and missing data. It focuses on latent variables and avoids estimation biases from unequal and too low or too high sample sizes (Henseler et al., 2015; Kock, 2019; Tenenhaus et al., 2005 ) . .7 | The multifunctionality pathway
The concept of ecosystem multifunctionality, the holistic view of the joint effects of different ecosystem functions, has important implications for the analysis of diversity– well- being relationships ( Manning et al., 2018 ) . Field work and simulation models have revealed that species diversity is positively linked to multifunctionality at different spatial scales (Allan et al., 2015; Hector & Bagchi, 2007; Meyer et al., 2018; Suárez- Castro et al., 2022; but see Birkhofer et al., 2018 ) . However, this link is partly implicit due to the definition of multifunctionality as the ability to provide multiple functions. These multiple functions require diversity.
Meyer et al. (2018) highlighted how the way of quantifying multifunctionality determines the strength of this relationship. Different metrics (using sums of standardized functioning values or respective ( 1)

ULRICH et al. upper thresholds possibly in combination with case- specific weight functions) have different statistical properties (Byrnes et al., 2014 ) . Unfortunately, no study so far has compared these metrics using standard benchmark tests. We feel that such a benchmarking is particularly necessary as the common ecological definition of multifunctionality is too imprecise to allow for unequivocal metric use and conclusions. In our view, it remains unclear whether observed multifunctionality– well- being relationships were merely the result of the choice of the metric– test statistics combination. An appropriate quantification of community or ecosystem multifunctionality might provide a direct link from underlying compositional diversity to the multifunctionality impact on well- being. .8 | The environmental pathway
Environmental conditions might directly influence human and animal well- being (FAO, 2021; MA, 2005 ) . In many instances, biodiversity and ecosystem functions directly influence these environmental conditions, form example in agricultural soils (Wall et al., 2015 ) . Therefore, and instead of looking at ecosystem services we might study the indirect impact of diversity on well- being using an environmental pathway. In this respect, the positive tripartite and quadripartite relationships between to soil diversity, fertility, and plant productivity (→ well- being) are well established (Delgado- Baquerizo et al., 2017 ) . However, this and other indirect diversity– human health relationships consider agricultural landscapes only. (e.g. McGuinness & Dowling, 2009) In turn, in a recent metagenomic comparison between organic and conventional farming Hausmann et al. (2022) failed to find significant differences in insect, particularly pollinator diversity that might influence plant productivity and food quality. The question whether and in which natural ecosystems higher diversity positively influences those environmental characteristics that might affect human well- being still deserves much attention and is far from being settled. We call for an integrative framework that identifies candidate positive and negative quadripartite relationships across various natural and anthropogenic habitats. | MEASUREMENT ISSUES
Diversity is quantified by species richness or some dimensionless ratio (e.g. Shannon index ) . Respectively, ecosystem functions and services are given either by ratios (stability or resilience ratios) or amounts with appropriate dimensions (e.g. monetary value or kg CO2 absorption × m−2 leaf area ) . Evaluating these by regressionbased models including ANOVA needs parameters that standardize dimensions to become comparable. Dimension analysis is a neglected aspect of ecological modelling as these are most often treated as simple normalization constants (e.g. Brown et al., 2004; Niklas & Hammond, 2019 ) . However, in multivariate analysis with several parameters, parameter interpretation and also possible parameter dependences are an increasing issue.
This autocorrelation effect of parameters has been intensively discussed within the biological scaling literature (e.g. Glazier, 2010; Peters, 1983) and stems mainly from external constraints acting on the parameters (Glazier, 2010 ) . In the ecological literature parameter autocorrelation of additive linear and nonlinear models has largely been ignored. Recently, Pillai and Gouhier (2019) have stimulated a discussion around non- independencies and parameters interpretation of the widely used Price partition (Fox, 2006; Loreau & Hector, 2001 ) . Pillai and Gouhier (2019) and van Veelen (2020) argued that the widely accepted partitioning of changes in plant trait expression into richness and complementary effects cannot unequivocally be used to infer positive effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning due to parameter non- independence (but see Ulrich et al., 2022 ) . This example highlights the possible problems in causal inference with respect to diversity effects on various other patterns and processes including human health. Similarly, the widely used partitioning of change in diversity, that is β- diversity, into effects of richness and community composition (Baselga, 2010; Podani & Schmera, 2011) does not necessarily result in fully independent partitions, again making unequivocal interpretation and causal inference challenging, particularly at small effect sizes of richness effects. .1 | Variability and well- being
Most studies on diversity, ecosystem functioning and well- being centre variable expressions averaged over focal habitats or landscapes. Our conceptual framework as shown in Figure 3 also relies on average parameter expressions. Recent theoretical (Loreau et al., 2021) and observational work (Allan et al., 2014; Gossner et al., 2016) however, drew attention to the importance of spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity causing variability in species richness and ecosystem functioning and to increasing faunal and floral homogenization in intensively used agricultural landscapes. From basic aggregation and insurance models of variability (Sevenster, 1996; Yachi & Loreau, 1999) it is now well understood how temporal and spatial variability in abundances and community composition enhances stability of aggregate ecological variables like biomass, productivity, soil production, water retention or carbon sequestration (Wang et al., 2021 ) .
The principal question is now whether and how variability in community composition (compositional diversity ) , in functional diversity, and in the expression of ecosystem services influences focal aspects of well- being. This question has not received sufficient attention so far but is of major theoretical interest (Garibaldi et al., 2018 ) . Do homogenous agricultural or otherwise managed landscapes with high levels of provisioning and non- provisioning ecosystem services contribute more to human well- being than more natural heterogeneous landscapes with lower levels of provisioning and non- provisioning ecosystem services? Quantification of the net benefits from these different landscapes would require data for ecosystem services and quantification of effects on well- being from a series of landscapes with different levels of diversity. , 2023, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10421 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [25/04/2023 ] .

ULRICH et al. .2 | Space– time discongruency
Any identification of the influence of ecosystem services on human well- being is confronted with the problem of space– time discongruency. By this we mean that studies on the influence of ecological diversity or functioning on aspects of human well- being are confronted by the time lags between changes in diversity and ecosystem functioning and visible well- being effects (Garibaldi et al., 2018 ) . The time interval required for measurable effect sizes is often unknown and clearly case specific. For example, invasive species often show a considerable period of slow population increase until negative effects on ecosystem functioning become visible (Crooks & Soulé, 1999; Gentili et al., 2021 ) . In this respect, threshold or tipping point effects need to be considered (e.g. Dakos et al., 2019 ) . For instance, a decline in pollinator richness negatively influences pollination and consequently crop or fruit production (e.g. Stein et al., 2017 ) . However, depending on crop or fruit type measurable effects might be visible only beyond some threshold level, while below the threshold functional responses in pollination might mask effectivity issues (e.g. Montoya- Pfeiffer et al., 2020 ) . Felipe- Lucia et al. (2020) have demonstrated how landscape homogenization might change the trade- offs between diversity, ecosystem functioning, and ecosystems services at regional scales. Therefore, we need information on the spatial scale at which diversity– well- being relationships might be apparent. .3 | Direct versus indirect testing
Most work on diversity– well- being relationships uses evidencebased inference testing the hypothesis of positive diversity effects ( cf. Marselle et al., 2021 ) . This is done within the Pearson- Neyman or Bayesian frameworks. Both approaches need comparatively strong evidence, that is high effect sizes, for hypothesis acceptance. Importantly, well- being is a process spread in time, where small effects during a lifetime might accumulate to gain visible consequences at an older age. Irrespective of the statistical framework we would either need long- term studies or a high number of single studies or study sites within a single analysis to reach common significance thresholds. However, such comparisons raise concerns of data comparability and compatibility. As a consequence of statistical rigour many positive diversity– well- being relationships will remain undetected leaving us with the simplest and most obvious relationships. These few detectable relationships may, however, not be the most important with respect to biodiversity management.

Direct inference from richness to well- being is often not possible (disrupted red arrow ) . Indirect inference uses a manifold of random 6 × 6 matrices (R1, R2, yellow ) . Multiplication of these matrices with the richness and well- being dissimilarity matrices ΔS and ΔH among sites provides estimates for the functioning dissimilarity matrix: ΔF = R1n × ΔS; ΔF = R2m × ΔH, tested for different values of m, m ≥ 1. A subset of matrices W1 and W2 that best provide estimates for ΔF are then compared for similar structures of weight values (green arrow ) .

ULRICH et al.
One way out of this dilemma would of course be the change of perspective. It is obvious that without wildlife humans would no longer exist. Therefore, the natural null hypothesis is that diversity begets well- being and contestants need to demonstrate the contrary. A more feasible solution might be based on indirect inference models as used in econometrics (Gouriéroux et al., 1993 ) . Indirect inference models are applied in cases where datasets are too large or where data are partly unsuited. They use a manifold of simulated relationships to estimate the most probable parameter combinations ( Jiang & Turnbull, 2004 ) . In community ecology, respective so- called reverse engineering models have been developed to estimate the most probable coefficients of competitive strength in multispecies communities, where the degrees of freedom are too high for direct analytical solutions (Ulrich et al., 2014 ) . Empirical Bayes approaches that estimate Bayesian priors from empirical data can also be seen from the indirect perspective and have been applied to the assessment of non- random species associations (Casella, 1985; Gotelli & Ulrich, 2010 ) .
With respect to diversity well- being relationships, we are confronted with the problem that the weight functions in Figure 3 that link diversities to ecosystem functioning values and subsequently functioning to well- being are generally not known. The limited numbers of sites in most studies do not allow for a direct analytical assessment. Therefore, we might use diversity, functioning, and well- being dissimilarity matrices obtained from a number of study sites and compare two randomly constructed matrices of weight values obtained from the linear and nonlinear fitting of richness and well- being to functioning (Figure 5 ) . This fitting with random matrices is repeated until a stable peak in goodness of fit is reached and might include calculations of thousands of matrices depending on the numbers of sites to be compared. If diversity and well- being were related, we should find some joint structures in the best fitting weight matrices. Importantly, these weight matrices might serve as priors in Bayesian analysis to apply to different sets of study sites.
RECOMMENDATIONS
This methodological review has to be seen as a cautionary note. Although positive direct and indirect influences of biodiversity on human well- being are most likely, unequivocal evidence is still scarce and restricted to cases like pollination— crop and honey production. These case studies are still important, but we call for a stricter terminology for the different aspects of functioning, multifunctionality and well- being (Figure 1) and highlight the need to evaluate each step in the pathways from diversity to well- being ( Figure 3 ) . More analyses should be based on matrix and path analytical techniques, and on functioning partitions including potential covariates rather than on bivariate comparisons. We call for appropriate long- term socio- ecological research platforms to gather relevant data about ecosystem functioning and well- being across space and time. We also highlight the need to consider potential trade- offs in diversity effects and to include ecosystem disservices for a full understanding of the ecological constraints on human well- being.

Abstract . There are strong links between heritage and the environment yet, heritage is not fully included in existing ecosystem- based frameworks. Different understandings of heritage values exist, and heritage values are not yet related to key value categories in environmental values research. . To address this gap and facilitate a common values- based approach, we develop a novel framework that links heritage and environmental values. First, we expand the understanding of heritage values by linking heritage to key environmental value categories. We then use the Life Framework of Values to show how heritage features in the different ways in which people relate to the world. . The resulting heritage values framework is operationalised by applying it to six case examples drawn from participatory research on the governance of European coastal and maritime heritage. . We found that the environment was not only considered to be a setting for heritage but was itself valued as heritage in different ways; that heritage is not extrinsic to the environment but is also a way in which people see meaning in the environment; and that multiple value frames and types were involved in shaping this perspective. The results highlight important discrepancies between stakeholders' perspectives and existing management approaches. | 369

AZZOPARDI et al. | INTRODUCTION
The multiple values of nature have long been of interest in sustainability and conservation, and efforts to highlight the plurality of values and mechanisms to integrate them into environmental valuations have intensified in recent years (Chan et al., 2016; Kenter et al., 2019; Raymond et al., 2018 ) . The importance of incorporating multiple values is increasingly being recognised by global initiatives such as the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the United Nations Decade for Ocean Science for Sustainable Development ( Díaz et al., 2018; IPBES 2022; Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 2021 ) , which stress the need for interdisciplinary approaches that address how people as individuals, groups, societies and their decision- making institutions, conceptualise, value, impact and relate to nature. In this paper, we argue that an important dimension of environmental valuation that could bridge disciplinary gaps but remains underdeveloped is heritage. We find that heritage is an important way in which people relate to and value the environment and thus offers a useful perspective on sustainability challenges.
Heritage is frequently differentiated in cultural or natural heritage. While this distinction is increasingly recognised as problematic, a sectoral management approach continues (Fredheim & Khalaf, 2016; Harrison, 2015; Tengberg et al., 2012 ) . In the heritage sector, the overlap between cultural and natural heritage is exemplified in normative conventions developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in which cultural heritage is an umbrella term that includes natural heritage and cultural landscapes (Bridgewater et al., 2007; UNESCO, 1972 ) . Yet, while the link between heritage and nature is often alluded to, the full implications of considering the heritage dimension and value of nature in unison are not yet well recognised nor elaborated in the conservation and sustainability fields. This has led to calls for greater cross- fertilisation of ideas between the cultural heritage and environmental management sectors to help bring clarity to how nature and culture are entwined through heritage (Bridgewater, 2017; Bridgewater et al., 2007; López Sánchez et al., 2020; Stephenson, 2008; Tengberg et al., 2012 ) . Scholars recognise that heritage and the environment are linked in multiple ways, not least in that some forms of heritage physically exist in an environmental space (Kenter, 2016a ) ; that heritage in terms of a way of life is determined and enabled by particular ecosystems thereby contributing to personal, social and group identities (Acott & Urquhart, 2014; Brennan, 2018; Hawke, 2002; Khakzad et al., 2015) and that heritage and the environment are linked as fundamental components of place or place identity (Arias- Arévalo et al., 2018; Brennan, 2018; Hawke, 2002; Kenter, 2016a; Urquhart et al., 2013 ) . The time- depth, and therefore heritage aspect, is further recognised in the notion of cultural landscapes (DeSilvey, 2012; Gee & Burkhard, 2010; Holtorf & Williams, 2015; Stephenson, 2008 ) . However, what is meant by heritage is rarely elaborated in sustainability research and heritage is often considered as something that exists alongside but is extrinsic to the natural environment.
In parallel with developments in ecosystem- based management, values- based approaches are also gaining traction in the heritage sector. However, the two fields diverge in approaches to values and the underpinning understanding of heritage values is not yet complete (Fredheim & Khalaf, 2016 ) . There is therefore an important link to be more fully developed between values, heritage and environmental management approaches, much of which will rely on better understanding of the range of values bound up in identifying what is heritage, how that heritage once identified is valued, what kinds of values heritage values are, how they relate to other types of values, why this matters to environmental management and how they can be incorporated in statutory and voluntary governance processes.
Heritage is currently included in the ecosystem services (ES) framework catalysed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MEA ) . Within the MEA, heritage, as heritage values, is included as a cultural ecosystem service (CES ) . CES is defined as the ‘nonmaterial benefits obtained from ecosystems’ (MEA, 2005 ) . However, the framing of heritage is vague and, in linking it specifically to benefits provided by ecosystems, is too narrow (Hølleland et al., 2017 ) . Furthermore, incorporating mainly the non- material aspects of heritage through heritage values excludes the material aspects of human relations with the environment, and heritage does not fit well within the fundamentally instrumental framing of the ES framework. The Nature's Contribution to People (NCP) framework adopted by IPBES (Díaz et al., 2015; Díaz et al., 2018) has sought to overcome these difficulties of ES, though the degree to which it has been successful has been debated (Coscieme et al., 2020; Kadykalo et al., 2019; Kenter, 2018; Peterson et al., 2018 ) , and heritage is still largely overlooked (Bridgewater, 2017 ) .
Here, we use the Life Framework of Values to show how heritage and heritage values can be linked to ecosystem- based management. . Applying the framework shows the ways in which heritage and nature are entwined by providing a structure for elucidating what can be valued as heritage, what values can inform heritage values and how heritage values feature in human– nature relations.

AZZOPARDI et al.
The Life Framework of Values was developed to overcome unidirectional, instrumental framings of nature as a source of benefits for people by exploring different ways in which the natural world matters using the frames of living from, living in, living as and living with nature (Kenter & O'Connor, 2022; O'Connor & Kenter, 2019 ) . By expanding beyond living from nature, the Life Framework offers a route for better integration and navigation of the multiple values and worldviews that shape human– nature interaction. These framings can be related to ES and NCP without being constrained by their conceptual and semantic limitations (Kenter, 2018; O'Connor & Kenter, 2019 ) , and thus has the potential to more fully include the scope of heritage and heritage values. The Life Framework was recently adopted by IPBES in its Values Assessment to organise different kinds of values and link them to the richness and diversity of worldviews and human- nature relations (Anderson et al., 2022; IPBES 2022.
We combine knowledge and key concepts from the thus far disparate research fields of heritage and environmental values to develop a new multi- faceted conceptualisation of heritage values. Drawing on knowledge from the heritage field, we incorporate a nuanced understanding of the interplay between materiality and non- materiality. We also draw on ongoing discourse in the heritage sector where heritage is considered temporally dynamic and changeable rather than static and fixed (DeSilvey, 2012; DeSilvey & Harrison, 2020; Flannery et al., 2022; Fredheim & Khalaf, 2016; Ounanianan et al., 2021; Stephenson, 2008; Tengberg et al., 2012 ) , indicating that perceptions of the environment, what is thought of as heritage and how it is valued can change over time. This perspective can be useful in considering environmental challenges with temporal dimensions (Everard et al., 2016; Kendal & Raymond, 2019 ) . Simultaneously, drawing on the work on environmental values can help elaborate the inclusion of more diverse value concepts and categories in the heritage sector. Having a common language for a values- based approach will facilitate the greater synergy called for between the two fields and can offer a route towards better addressing conflicts in decision- making.
Building on this multidisciplinary ground, we develop a novel framework that incorporates both the expanded conceptualisation of heritage values and, through the Life Framework, the ways in which heritage and heritage values matter in human– nature relations. In this paper, we focus on the heritage values of the natural environment, but the framework can be applied more broadly. First, we link key concepts from the environmental values literature to heritage (Section 2 ) , we then link this with the Life Framework of Values to create a new framework (Section 3 ) . This is then operationalised in application to six case examples (Section 4 ) . These cases are associated with the EU Horizon 2020 PERICLES project,1 which focused on the participatory governance of coastal and maritime heritage and its place in broader marine and coastal issues. The results are used to reflect on the framework and consider the potential synergies and conflicts that can arise between stakeholder interests ( Section 5 ) . | HERITAGE AND VALUES
Values have been considered from several disciplinary perspectives, with the term ‘values’ referring to diverse concepts (Dietz et al., 2005; Hejnowicz & Rudd, 2017; Kenter et al., 2015, 2019; Pascual et al., 2017; Raymond et al., 2019 ) , resulting in a lack of clarity over the term (Rawluk et al., 2019 ) . Key value types in the environmental sustainability discourse include transcendental values, instrumental values, intrinsic values and relational values. These values can be considered through diverse indicators and through multiple value lenses. They can be expressed individually or by groups, communities, cultures and societies as shared or social values ( Kenter et al., 2015; Stephenson, 2008 ) . We briefly consider these categories to develop an expanded approach to heritage values.
A central distinction is between transcendental values that signify broad guiding principles, and more specific contextual values that pertain to a particular object of value. Transcendental values have also been referred to as held or basic values (Chan et al., 2018; James, 2015; Kenter et al., 2015; Kenter et al., 2019; Muraca, 2011; O'Neill et al., 2008; Raymond et al., 2018 ) . Transcendental values are often shared within and across cultures, as they result from socialisation (Ishihara, 2018; Kenter et al., 2015 ) . Transcendental values applicable to heritage and the environment include a respect for tradition, unity with nature (Schwartz et al., 1994) and living well alongside other species and the natural world (Nussbaum, 2000 ) .
Contextual values have also been referred to as assigned values ( Raymond et al., 2018 ) . They can be expressed by individuals, but also collectively expressed as shared or social values (Kenter et al., 2015, ). They have traditionally been distinguished as either intrinsic or instrumental. Instrumental value refers to an object's extrinsic value, that is, its value for the sake of something else (O'Neill, 1992 ) . If an object is valued instrumentally, the object itself is considered substitutable if the benefit it provides can be maintained or the desired end achieved (Arias- Arévalo et al., 2018 ) . Intrinsic value is based on the inherent worth of an object. This can stem from (i) the value an object has independent of its instrumental value; (ii) the value an object has independently of valuers and (iii) the value an object has based on its inherent properties (O'Neill, 1992 ) . An object considered to have intrinsic value is not substitutable with regard to that value.
A fuzzier category of values is relational values. While the relationality of values and the value of relationships have been considered for some time, the term has recently gained prominence in relation to ES and NCP (Chan et al., 2016, 2018; Himes & Muraca, 2018) and can be thought of more as a boundary object than a precise ethical category (Stålhammar & Thorén, 2019 ) . Generally, they refer to the meaningfulness of relationships and the contributions of these relationships to a ‘good life’ (Chan et al., 2016 ) , though they have also been more precisely delineated as non- instrumental and non- substitutable, yet anthropocentric in that they depend on people as valuers (Himes & Muraca, 2018; Kenter & O'Connor, 2022; O'Connor & Kenter, 2019 ) . When a relationship is the object of value, relational values can be considered a type of contextual value. , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al.
Intrinsic, instrumental and relational values are not mutually exclusive; something can be important for its own sake, for its benefits and for relationships people have with it that are more than merely instrumental. Relational values can also be considered as principles that guide relationships, and in this way refer to transcendental values (Gould et al., 2019 ) .
The term ‘values’ has also been used to indicate the importance or worth of an object expressed through value indicators, which are expressions of value in different units (Kenter et al., 2015 ) . Indicators of environmental value are often separated in economic (use and non- use) values; biophysical or ecological values; and sociocultural values (Jacobs et al., 2016 ) . Additionally, values are themselves only a part of the whole of the meaning of an object (James, 2019 ) , and heritage values can themselves be part of total value. For example, cultural landscapes can have heritage as well as, aesthetic, recreational, instrumental, relational and spiritual values. More explicitly, a designed garden which is managed as a heritage property may be valued in terms of cultural heritage, but it may also be valued because it is beautiful and offers opportunities for recreation or inspiration. A cultural landscape such as saltpan coastlines or terraced fields, may have heritage value but in providing food and livelihoods, will also have instrumental and possibly relational value. While value indicators facilitate the articulation of something difficult to express, the danger is of the value and/or the meaning of something being reduced to only that which can be expressed by indicators.
Finally, values can be seen through value lenses which are essentially ‘lenses of worthiness’ that identify what is important and how (Kenter et al., 2019 ) . Different knowledge traditions harbour different value lenses, which are underpinned by different epistemic and procedural assumptions (meta- lenses ) , that determine how values can be known and assessed (Kenter et al., 2019 ) . These value lenses and meta- lenses are also important in terms of distinguishing whether transcendental and contextual values are considered from a primarily individualistic or shared- social perspective.
There is some overlap in current understandings of heritage values in the heritage and environmental management sectors. Value is a foundational idea in the heritage sector (de la Torre & Mason, 2002; DeSilvey & Harrison, 2020; Fredheim & Khalaf, 2016 ) , where heritage values are understood in two different ways: the value of heritage objects and the values held for heritage objects. In both, heritage values are contextual values. The first interpretation is based on the value inherent within a heritage object and is based on intrinsic value ( DeSilvey & Harrison, 2020; Mason, 2002 ) . Intrinsic value is considered somewhat differently here from the environmental field, referring to objective properties of the heritage object, but which are not necessarily independent of human values. Heritage values are then understood to be the ways in which a heritage object is significant, for example, the cultural, economic, political, aesthetic, historic, age, scientific and educational value of heritage (Díaz- Andreu, 2017; Fredheim & Khalaf, 2016; Mason, 2002 ) . However, such categories describe different indicators or proxies for heritage value, there is therefore little distinction between the contextual heritage value and the characteristics of an object used to explicate its value. In the second interpretation, heritage values are defined as the subjective ‘meanings and values that individuals or groups of people bestow on heritage’ (Díaz- Andreu, 2017 ) , that is, individual or social values for heritage objects. This perspective is linked to a drive for greater public participation in heritage management (de la Torre & Mason, 2002; Díaz- Andreu, 2017; Tengberg et al., 2012; Waterton & Smith, 2010 ) . In the ES field, heritage values are similarly defined as: ‘many societies place high value on the maintenance of either historically important landscapes (“cultural landscapes”) or culturally significant species’ (MEA, 2005: 40 ) , echoing the understanding of heritage values as social values for heritage objects.
As contextual values these heritage values may then be intrinsic, instrumental and/or relational. For example, a cultural landscape may have particular geographic– historic and aesthetic features that can be assessed using various descriptors to provide indication of quality or significance. These indicators reveal the extent to which the underlying intrinsic or relational meaning is significant (e.g. its historical properties independent of the degree to which these might generate benefits) and what instrumental value can be drawn from it (e.g. tourism revenue ) .
Thus, current definitions of heritage values account for values either as contextual opinions of worth (generally without making explicit what type of contextual values) or as indicators of significance. In all interpretations of heritage values, the fundamental issues of what is valued as heritage in the first place, and what contextual and transcendental values influence this identification are overlooked, and there is little recognition of what sort of values might inform a heritage value ‘lens of worthiness’ outside of value indicators. .1 | An expanded interpretation of heritage values
To develop a common values- based approach to heritage and the environment, we link heritage to the key value categories outlined above, as summarised in Table 1. Each category is considered to be part of an expanded understanding of heritage values. We use the term ‘object’ in a general sense throughout to refer to anything that can be ascribed value which in this paper includes cultural landscapes, biotic and abiotic features of the environment, and states of affairs, for example, the value of or for a particular landscape being in a certain condition. .2 | Heritage and the Life Framework of Values
Thus far, we have outlined an expanded understanding of heritage values. However, this can generate complexity, and does not fully get to the heart of the basic ways in which people relate to natural and cultural heritage and consider how it matters. The Life Framework of Values was developed to encapsulate the four main ways in which nature matters; how we live from nature, live in nature, live with nature and live as nature. Though the Life Framework was originally conceived in the context of environmental values , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al. ( O'Connor & Kenter, 2019; O'Neill et al., 2008 ) , it concerns people's living relations with the more- than- human world. The framework does not impose a view of nature and culture as separate, nor do they impose a specific worldview when considering these relations.
‘Living from’ frames the ways in which people are sustained by the environment, including food, energy, shelter and livelihoods, and other ways that nature allows people to prosper. This frame foregrounds instrumental values, emphasising a flow of benefits from the environment to people. However, it also captures relational values linked to people's quality of life, including education, learning and inspiration, all of which are benefits that can directly sustain people's livelihoods and wellbeing. In heritage terms, the living from frame pertains to ways in which heritage is used as an educational, economic or livelihood resource and links to practices that are directly based on living from nature, for example, a heritage of fishing or farming. The second frame, living in the world, refers to how the environment forms the stage of our lives; from developing cultural identities to shaping cultural practices. Heritage, tangible and intangible, contributes to sense of place and place identity and therefore shapes and is part of the world we live in. The third frame refers to how we live with the more- than- human world as one species among many. This frame captures the way in which the more- than- human world, including other species, ecosystems and natural processes, exists independent of human self- concern. This foregrounds intrinsic values, but also transcendental relational values such as beauty, stewardship and reciprocity and the ways that these translate in contextual values. In heritage terms, living with can refer to heritage that people are aware of but do not personally relate to (e.g. the heritage of others ) , or it can apply to heritage that is outside personal awareness (e.g. submerged heritage ) . The living as frame refers to the way in which other species, ecosystems, geodiversity and biocultural diversity form webs of life and social- ecological systems that we are part of, and where ‘culture’ or people and ‘nature’ are not meaningfully separated. This is also expressed through indigenous expressions of kinship through which natural entities are valued as extensions of individual and collective selves. Relational and intrinsic values are foregrounded and closely associated. In heritage terms, living as comes into play when there is a perspective or direct experience of oneness, or being an inseparable part of cultural landscapes or the natural world including through heritage- related practices. Living as perspectives can also be expressed and reproduced through heritage. For example, traditional stories, songs and performances can define relationships with species, landscapes or nature more generally.
The frames are not mutually exclusive; for example, natural heritage may be seen as part of oneself (living as) and at the same time be important as place or space (living in) and as a source of sustenance (living from ) . Kenter and O'Connor (2022) point out that the living as frame can be seen as ontologically distinct from the others, but can also, through its particular ontological perspective, provide a lens through which to see the other frames in a more holistic, less dualistic way. The ways in which different value categories and their expression as heritage values link to the four Life Frames are summarised in Table 2. | A FRAMEWORK FOR HERITAGE VALUES
A novel framework for the heritage values of the natural environment that incorporates the multiple dimensions of an expanded understanding of heritage values (Table 1) and the Life Framework TA B LE 1 Dimensions of heritage values
Description
Transcendental values and heritage
Broad principles and life goals that transcend specific situations can pertain to heritage. Examples of transcendental values applicable to heritage and the environment include respect for tradition, unity with nature and living well alongside other species and the natural world
Contextual heritage values
Values related to specific objects of heritage value a. Instrumental
The benefits people obtain from heritage, for example, visitor revenue or use in deliberate national identity construction b. Intrinsic
The non- instrumental and non- substitutable significance of a heritage object, without reference to relationships with people
Relational values
As transcendental values: the broad principles that define desirable relationships with heritage
As contextual values: the importance of non- substitutable, non- instrumental relationships with heritage objects, or of heritage relationships between people, or people and nature
Heritage value as part of total value
Heritage value can be a part of the total value of an object. For example, saltpan coastlines may have heritage value but in providing food and livelihoods, will also have instrumental and possible relational value independent of heritage value
Heritage value indicators
Heritage value may be expressed in terms of an object's economic value, historic value, educational value or aesthetic properties
Heritage value lens
A heritage value lens is a perspective that identifies something as having heritage value in the first place. Value lenses are not value- neutral and different values shape a value lens. Thus, different people may have different heritage value lenses, which may change over time , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al. of Values (Table 2) was developed as shown in Figure 1. Combining the two within one framework allows for the simultaneous identification of multiple heritage values that may be pertinent in any given situation, enables the inclusion of different groups of people, and through the Life Frames, shows how they bear on to human– nature relations.
In the next section, this framework is operationalised by applying it to six case examples to illustrate the ways in which elements of the natural environment can be valued as heritage and how. | CASE EXAMPLES
The PERICLES project (2018– 2021) was funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research programme to enable the conservation, sustainable use and participatory governance of maritime and coastal cultural heritage. We focus here on six PERICLES case examples (Figure 2) designed as exploratory case studies to address specific heritage governance challenges. At the core of each is taking a participatory approach to identifying what is valued as cultural heritage; the participants engaged and the methods used are summarised in Table S1. It was made clear throughout that the research aim was to identify valued cultural heritage, but without providing a hard or exclusive definition of this term; thus, the results represent participants' interpretation of their cultural heritage. Ethical approval for the fieldwork was granted by research institutions in each region. Participants were informed, verbally and in writing, about the aims and objectives of the project and about their right to withdraw at any time; written informed consent was given by all participants.
The Iroise Sea, Golfe du Morbihan and Lake Vistonis examples are within natural parks. The Ria de Aveiro, west coast of Ireland and Clyde marine region examples include protected areas and classification measures safeguarding species or habitats but are not managed within a nature reserve framework. .1 | Study areas .1.1 | Parc Naturel Régional du Golfe du Morbihan
The Parc Naturel Régional du Golfe du Morbihan (PNRGM) is organised around a multi- stakeholder collaborative project of sustainable development, based on the protection and enhancement of the area's rich natural and cultural heritage. The management of natural areas sometimes generates conflicts of use and PNRGM is currently initiating a strategy for the management and the enhancement of natural and cultural maritime heritage which is based on taking a participatory approach to identifying sites and objects of heritage value. .1.2 | The Iroise Sea
The Iroise Sea Natural Marine Park is also a biosphere reserve under UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme.2 The area is important for its kelp forests which for centuries have been exploited for agriculture and glass and iodine production. Following the establishment of the park, the kelp forests and seaweed harvesting activities were classified as co- dependent natural and cultural heritage TA B LE 2 The life framework of values and heritage

AZZOPARDI et al. that should be conserved. The management structure ensures that multiple stakeholders are involved in maintaining both heritages. It is however a balance that needs to be actively maintained as management responses are developed to new threats that require a divergence from traditional solutions. For example, the system of rotating harvesting areas to avoid overexploitation necessitates ongoing negotiation of who has access to kelp in which areas and when, which differs from the traditional practice of each harvester having a patch to work as they see fit. .1.3 | Lake Vistonis
Lake Vistonis is a part of the National Park of East Macedonia and Thrace, it is protected under the Ramsar convention and is also a part of the Natura 2000 network, with a focus on bird conservation. The sea south of the lagoons is fished intensively and the lagoon itself has been physically shaped through centuries of traditional fishing using permanent fish traps (the dalyan method ) . Fishing depends on a healthy lagoonal ecosystem which supports the renewal of fish populations; some fishers operate in both the lagoon and the sea and have a vested interest in both systems. Additionally, maintaining ecological balance is a common interest between conservationists and the fishing cooperative who have developed a successful modus vivendi. The Park's framework does emphasise the importance of cultural heritage and including traditional activities (Papayannis, 2008; Papayannis & Pritchard, 2011 ) ; however, the inclusion of traditional fishing methods has not yet been fully explored nor incorporated into the conservation narrative. .1.4 | West coast of Ireland
Galway Bay and Killary Harbour in Ireland contain iconic land and seascapes and a strong coastal and maritime heritage strongly linked to Irish identity and which feature in Ireland's coastal tourism strategies (Pafi et al., 2020 ) . Galway Bay has also been identified as a key site for Ireland's Blue Growth strategy (Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, 2012 ) . In the study locations, Blue Growth is seen as both an opportunity and a threat and increasing tourism and emergence of Blue Growth industries have caused tension with local communities who argue that proposed developments threaten the area's unique tangible and intangible cultural heritage. .1.5 | Ria de Aveiro
The Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon is one of the largest, most biologically significant coastal wetlands in Portugal (DGOTDU, 2004) and a suite of measures protects the diverse habitats and bird species. It is also the site of centuries of human activity including shipbuilding, fishing, eel canning, seaweed gathering and salt production which have shaped the identity of the region but many of which have declined (Martins et al., 2013 ) . Some have reinvented themselves by exploiting the cultural heritage element for tourism (Sousa et al., 2013 ) , others have disappeared along with their associated cultural landscapes (Martins et al., 2020 ) . Research described here was intended to address the risk to tangible and intangible heritage. .1.6 | Clyde marine region
The Clyde marine region is one of 11 Scottish marine regions created to facilitate implementation of the National Marine Plan. The Clyde and the Firth of Clyde are well known for their shipbuilding, maritime transport and fishing heritage, all of which are sectors that are now in decline or undergoing significant change (Phillips et al., 2018 ) . The region includes a network of environmental protected heritage and natural sites; however, one remaining pertinent issue in marine planning is identifying heritage of value beyond that which is already officially designated or protected.
FI G U R E 1 A new framework for the heritage values of the natural environment that shows how different dimensions of heritage values interact and link to the Life Framework. Arrows indicate influence: a heritage value lens influences all the dimensions of heritage value. There is a reciprocal relationship between a heritage value lens and transcendental and contextual values. Transcendental values influence contextual values, which, in turn, influence value indicators. The Life framework can be used to understand different heritage value lenses and the transcendental and contextual values linked a value lens. , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al. .2 | Analysis and results
For this study, analysis focused on what participants identified and valued as cultural heritage. First, objects identified by participants as having heritage value were listed (Table S2) and categorised (Table 3 ) . The categories were delineated by the researchers to aid analysis and are intended to be illustrative rather than definitive. The cultural landscape categorisation is based on UNESCO's cultural landscape categories (Mitchell et al., 2009: 19 ) . We recognise the view that ‘natural’ environments are anthropogenically co- produced (Fish, 2011; Stenseke, 2018; Stephenson, 2008 ) ; however, here we maintain the distinction to reflect our understanding of participants' basis of value. The framework introduced in Figure 1 was operationalised by applying it to the case examples retrospectively by the researchers active in each area. Finally, each case example was assessed against each of the dimensions of the framework (Table 4 ) .
This work therefore takes an interpretivist approach in relating value categories to what participants identified as having heritage value and in the retrospective application of the framework, which is intended to assess its comprehensiveness, robustness and applicability. Values are understood to be place based rather than abstract and social rather than individual; the values expressed by individual participants are understood to represent their broader social environments as elicited through the social processes of the participatory workshops and group deliberation exercises (Kenter et al., 2019) used throughout the PERICLES project. .2.1 | Life Frames
Applying the framework showed that several Life Frames were relevant in each case and that heritage mattered in multiple ways. The frames of living from, in and with were relevant throughout, although the objects of heritage value differed. Tangible heritage such as buildings, maritime heritage and heritage places contributed to place identity and featured in the living in frame but as installations that support livelihoods or as sources of recreation or education (e.g. saltpans, wrecks) they also associated with the living from frame. In this way, some heritage objects filled different roles across frames. There was also a temporal dimension to these objects as they are representative of people living from and in the world in the past, but also shape the present- world participants lived in. The past and present of living from and in the world was also represented by heritage as memory. These heritage objects could also be interpreted in terms of living with by people who recognise value in the heritage of others but do not personally relate to them, or where heritage was not interacted with (e.g. wrecks for non- divers ) . Participants also valued many biotic and abiotic features of the natural environment FI G U R E 2 Map of the case example locations. , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al. as heritage through a living with frame, recognising heritage value in the lives of different species and environments without reference to livelihoods or place, or where species important for practices were also regarded in terms of their intrinsic value. The living as frame was, in some cases, co- emergent with living from, for example, where fishers or kelp harvesters described themselves as an integral part of and co- producers of a landscape or natural– cultural system, without a clear separation between people and nature. .2.2 | Heritage value lens
A point of note is the range of environmental, as well as humanmade, objects participants identified as cultural heritage. Objects typically considered to be cultural heritage were identified everywhere (e.g. monuments, sites, wrecks, buildings ) , yet participants' responses illustrate a much broader view of what constitutes heritage.

AZZOPARDI et al. heritage; the combination was considered cultural heritage as were the constituent elements. This applied to the range of human- made objects included, but also in the sense that natural objects, even those without no or little apparent human influence (e.g. beaches, coves, rivers) were valued as heritage. Particular species were also identified as cultural heritage. Some, such as the wild salmon in Scotland and the grey mullet in Vistonis, could be considered culturally iconic species, but others including broad categories such as ‘wildlife’ and ‘fish’ could not, indicating that living creatures were valued as heritage also without associated cultural symbolism. In Ireland and Aveiro, species linked to past activities, as well as the activities themselves, were valued as heritage. In the Iroise sea, the traditional practice of kelp harvesting, although modernised, is still practiced as a traditional way of life, that is, heritage. .2.3 | Heritage value as part of whole value
Heritage value as part of whole value manifested in two ways. First, in that within some single objects or activities, heritage value was part of the whole of its value. Second, the objects identified as heritage were part of a larger whole which could itself be valued as heritage, for example, cultural landscapes like the saltpans as part of the Aveiro lagoon, or the yellow rocks characteristic of parts of the west coast of Ireland. In short, objects of heritage value can also be part of larger assemblages of heritage value. The examples also show how cultural landscapes have multiple associated values, including but not limited to heritage value (Stephenson, 2008 ) . On the other hand, the heritage value of a cultural landscape was not always fully recognised, as was the case in Vistonis, where recognition of heritage as part of the value of the lagoon is an incomplete, ongoing process. .2.4 | Transcendental values
The range of objects valued as heritage indicate that nature- related transcendental values, as well as those linked to tradition, were influential in shaping participants' perspectives. This suggests that heritage and tradition are not inextricably linked and that heritage value lenses can be shaped by principles that do not appear to be heritagerelated based on a conventional conceptualisation of heritage. .2.5 | Contextual values
The contextual values relevant in each case were partly dependent on the participants engaged. For example, for the harvesters in the Iroise sea, kelp had instrumental value because they earned a living from it, that is, it was valued as a means to an end. It has also been protected as heritage based on this instrumental value. However, if the kelp was only valued instrumentally, then it would be substitutable, but this is not the case because of the heritage dimension. It is central for the continuation of a traditional way of life that has a non- substitutable relational value. Simultaneously, conservationists and harvesters themselves may also value the kelp in intrinsic terms. Other species such as yellow lichen, sea pink or gannets that no longer have instrumental value were valued in terms of both their intrinsic value and relational value as heritage. .2.6 | Heritage value indicators
Heritage value indicators were not mentioned at all by any of the participants. This is likely a consequence of the fact that the main objective of the participatory work was to explore what participants considered to be heritage and the values associated with that rather than to discuss each heritage object in depth. | DISCUSSION
It is widely argued that legitimate and effective environmental and heritage management must understand and incorporate multiple values (Chan et al., 2016, 2018; Grubert, 2018; Hejnowicz & Rudd, 2017; Jacobs et al., 2016; Kenter, 2016b; Pascual et al., 2017; Raymond et al., 2019; Stenseke, 2018; Stephenson, 2008 ) . However, the multiple understandings of the term ‘values’ and different epistemic lenses are significant barriers to effective integration (Kendal et al., 2015; Kenter et al., 2015, 2019; Rawluk et al., 2019 ) . Our results suggest three key points: (1) important differences in value lenses mean that what is valued as heritage, and how it is valued, is not fully reflected in existing management approaches; (2) heritage matters in human– nature relationships in multiple, overlapping ways; and (3) recognising the temporal situatedness of values and objects of value is essential in understanding the ways in which heritage matters and influences present human– nature relations. We will discuss these points in the following two subsections, the temporal situatedness is a thread that runs throughout. .1 | Different lenses
The case studies illustrated a key question in terms of value lenses: whether heritage is (a) seen as part of the total value of something, as is typical in the environmental field, where it may be seen as a CES, or as part of non- use, sociocultural or relational value; (b) seen as the whole of the value of an object as is typical in the heritage sector; or (c) is a way of seeing meaning in the natural- cultural environment, where it is the perceived fact of heritage that fundamentally underpins natural, economic and sociocultural values.
Ultimately, heritage is what we attribute heritage value to (Tengberg et al., 2012 ) . Here natural and cultural objects both emerged as objects of heritage value, as also found by Stephenson (2008 ) , Kenter et al. (2016) and Historic Environment Scotland (2017 ) , demonstrating that the heritage value lens of civil society differs from that of experts in either sector. Furthermore, in not showing significant differences , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] . See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | People and Nature
AZZOPARDI et al. across the case regions, our results indicate that heritage lenses have similar characteristics across geographically disparate communities. While our results indicate that heritage can be valued instrumentally, the intrinsic and relational values entwined in heritage value confer varying degrees of non- substitutability for elements of the environment that other perspectives may not, with implications for policy and management. Given different perspectives, aspects that are valued as heritage can be overlooked when using an environmental management lens. The fact that species were identified as well as, but also separately to, a related practice is surprising and may indicate that as contexts change and activities pass into the past, then heritage values expand beyond the lost or declining practice to also include the natural species as heritage. Therefore, environmental valuations would be enriched by recognising the temporal situatedness of heritage value ( Raymond et al., 2019; Stephenson, 2008; Tengberg et al., 2012 ) .
Looking at the world through a heritage lens can facilitate crosssectoral dialogue; however, a heritage value lens may also lead to, or reinforce, existing differences in cases where a desire to protect endangered ecological systems comes into conflict with a desire to continue a practice valued as heritage. This can be a conflict between different heritage value lenses (e.g. valuing elements of the natural environment as heritage vs valuing practices or ways of life as heritage ) , or it can be a conflict between a heritage value lens and an environmental value lens that does not have a heritage component, it can even be a conflict that exits within one individual who may well value both heritage and endangered ecosystems. Either way, in such situations, it becomes especially important to address deep- seated values, although these are, as yet, rarely considered in ecosystem assessments ( Raymond et al., 2019; Raymond & Kenter, 2016 ) . Another issue that then comes into play is the traditional, often implicit, desire to ‘protect’ heritage, to pass it on unchanged. Yet, it is increasingly recognised that in some cases, heritage must be adaptable to survive or indeed to be current rather than exclusively of the past. Heritage is not, and often cannot be, a fixed and unchanging thing (Holtorf, 2018 ) . In such conflict situations, explicit recognition of heritage value should be seen as a starting point for mutually respectful discussions towards sustainability or mutually beneficial processes rather than a perspective that is used to shut discussion down.
Both Lake Vistonis and the Iroise Sea are part of natural parks, where a conservationist stance is part of their raison d'etre, yet room for dialogue has been found in the interplay between transcendental values operating within this framing such as a desire to protect nature and a desire to respect tradition, both of which are likely to be considered non- substitutable. Dialogue can lead to more practicable outcomes but is dependent on the current states of both the practice and the resource; one may need to be prioritised in the short term to reach a point where finding a long- term balance becomes a feasible option. Thus, negotiating deep- seated values will benefit from explicit inclusion of a temporal element to add context to specific management actions such as a transition to rotating kelp harvesting zones. This highlights the importance of including transcendental values in framing heritage values, and indeed multiple values of nature more broadly (Cooper et al., 2016; Hicks et al., 2015; Ives & Kidwell, 2019; Kenter et al., 2016; Raymond et al., 2019; Raymond & Kenter, 2016 ) , because they highlight that management challenges are not so much trade- offs between different contextual values, but rather moral conflicts between different potential aims and sought outcomes of management, as also investigated empirically by Isacs et al. (2022 ) . .2 | Life Frames of heritage: how heritage matters
The Life Framework provided an effective way to navigate and link different value categories and objects of heritage. The relevance of several Life Frames across the examples demonstrates the multiple ways in which heritage matters, how this may change over time and therefore how the frames can merge or shift from one to another over time. For example, the Ria de Aveiro case demonstrates how living from can be temporally situated. Here, heritage value was informed by a perspective of living from the lagoon in the past, current management actions could also be framed as living from by generating heritage- related tourism businesses, but also in terms of living with or living in in the present. Thus, even while it might not be the dominant frame relevant in the present, the historical living from frame still plays a large part in present place identity (living in ) . This suggests that incorporating a temporal approach may be especially important in negotiating transition in areas that had strong industries valued as a traditional way of life, but which are now in decline, in other words where the value frames are shifting from living from to living with or living in.
The frames of living with and living as were less explicitly represented, which either confronts the conceptual underpinnings of heritage value lenses or the applicability of the frames to heritage. The results suggest that living with becomes relevant in heritage terms in large part because elements of the environment were valued as heritage. This brings transcendental values relevant to the living with frame, such as the desire to live well alongside other species and/or to protect nature, that are largely predicated on the intrinsic value of ‘the other’, into play. This frame also pertains to how we lived with other species in the past which directly shapes the world as it exists now, and which combined with how we live with them now will ripple into the world of the future. Living with also applied to the heritage of others and to heritage objects that are not necessarily valued by everyone. For example, in Scotland, the heritage of some participants (e.g. inshore trawler fishing) conflicted with the sustainability worldviews of others. Some participants recognised the heritage value to others but did not relate to it themselves and even viewed it negatively in terms of how they wished to live with other species. This again underscores the need to explicitly incorporate multiple stakeholders and their values and frames in policy, planning and management actions.
The living as frame primarily arose in relation to fishers and harvesters seeing themselves as an inherent part co- producer of their natural– cultural environments. The close co- emergence of multiple frames in these examples supports allusions by Kenter and , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al.
O'Connor (2021) that the living as frame is not just a frame in itself, but can also function as an ontological lens through which the other frames are considered, and where all three types of contextual values are bridged: fish and kelp were valued for their own sake, instrumentally to support livelihoods, and relationally as significant part of someone's life and means of unity with the natural world. .3 | Further reflections
Overall, the framework worked well, by linking heritage to key value categories we were able to explicitly and methodically question different kinds of heritage values which illuminated the multiple bases of heritage value. Questioning these further was enlightening, for example, in realising that heritage is not necessarily linked to a respect for tradition and that heritage value almost by definition appears to confer a degree of non- substitutability, even where it may be originally grounded in instrumental value. Incorporating the Life Framework brought clarity in navigating the complexity of multiple overlapping values and demonstrated that the Life Frames were applicable to heritage in a straightforward way, which is a novel application of the Life Framework. In aiding clarity in complexity, incorporating the Life Framework can be a boon to understand and bridge different stakeholder positions in terms of why heritage is important, and it was readily and intuitively understood and applied by PERICLES project partners as a way to organise the case data.
Explicitly addressing each of the frames helped expand our understanding of how heritage matters. It revealed a clear predominance of living from and in perspectives and interesting overlaps and links between multiple frames. Living as was least apparent in terms of heritage across our case examples. A key question then is whether a heritage lens is well suited to identifying living as or if this frame is better identified using other approaches. Research interpretations may differ from participants' own views of how they relate to the world and living as may have been obscured in our interpretative approach grounded in secondary data. None of the frames were explicitly prompted for, which may mean that living as framings and values may have been more present than suggested by our interpretation but did not come to the fore (Harmáčková et al., 2021 ) .
With regard to our broader conceptualisation, having a relatively simple framework to guide the unpicking of heritage values was useful. Through our interpretative approach, the data could be understood against the main value categories, but where appropriate the framework can be expanded in other applications to include further dimensions (e.g. Kenter et al., 2019; Rawluk et al., 2019 ) , such as further epistemic and procedural questions.
Operationalising the framework highlighted that heritage value indicators were not explicitly mentioned by participants, which could be a result of the fieldwork design as well as of the participants included. This is also congruent with recent conceptualisations (Breyne et al., 2021) that distinguish sociocultural values in terms of their meaning, which comes out well through our interpretive- deliberative approach, and their ‘performance’, which is more typically assessed through an indicator- based approach. Value indicators do play a significant role in both heritage and environmental management as well as in spatial management approaches that aim to integrate heritage such as Marine Spatial Planning (Böhnke- Henrichs et al., 2013 ) . We consider value indicators to be an important part of the framework where it is being operationalised in contexts where indicators are being assessed. The key message is to recognise the difference between value indicators and other ways of understanding heritage value. In these instances, performance value indicators would also need to be clearly distinguished from value indicators as proxies of value.
A heritage value lens here served to bring a temporal perspective to why people value things in the ways that they do that may have otherwise remain hidden, including showing how multiple Life Frames play into each other over time and can overlap in the present. As described above, explicitly recognising this can be particularly useful in areas which had strong industries in the past which are now changing or are in decline, as for example an increasing shift from wild fisheries to aquaculture in many areas. In this way, the framework can be used to help inform initiatives that seek to bring about change which may impact areas or industries that foster a strong heritage connection such as the commitment to Just Transitions to environmentally and socially sustainable economies in Scotland (Scottish Government, 2021 ) . Heritage will likely also be relevant in terms of how transition occurred in the past which may still influence perspectives on current management approaches. For example, the closure of the culturally and historically important herring fishery in the UK in the 1970s had severe and long- lasting impacts on the industry (Dickey- Collas et al., 2010 ) , which may well influence buy- in to current management actions.
The framework can also be used to facilitate cross- sectoral dialogue when different organisations are working together on joint actions which seek to include multiple values (e.g. the People, Place and Landscape Action Plan issued by NatureScot and Historic Environment Scotland, 2019, the public bodies responsible for natural and cultural heritage in Scotland ) . In bridging both sectors, the framework could be used as a reflexive tool for the management actors involved as well as way of drawing in and interrogating the values of other stakeholders, although its success in doing so has yet to be validated empirically, as our current study was retrospective. Finally, the framework was here applied to participatory work in coastal and marine contexts only. We expect that the structure of heritage values will not change significantly in relation to different ecosystem or practice- based contexts, and we anticipate that the framework should be readily applicable in other contexts, but this remains to be tested. | CONCLUSION
In this paper, we sought to bridge a gap between heritage and ecosystem- based management. We attempted to do so by developing and operationalising a novel framework intended to facilitate a common values- based approach. In applying the framework to participatory work across diverse countries, we discovered that , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10386 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

AZZOPARDI et al. heritage and the environment are linked in ways that are not typically fully reflected by existing frameworks and approaches.
Participants did not meaningfully distinguish between cultural and natural heritage; the environment was not only a setting for human- made heritage objects but was itself valued as heritage. While this is increasingly recognised in high- level normative conventions, it is yet to be fully realised in existing sectoral approaches on the ground, potentially resulting in certain frames and types of values being emphasised over others. Thus, there is a misalignment in stakeholder value lenses, highlighting the importance of participatory approaches that explicitly address motivating principles and value lenses that either (a) result in outcomes that are balanced across all dimensions of sustainability and/or (b) can be more transparent in recognising conflicts in management decisions for the longterm benefit of people and planet.
As such, our framework provides opportunities for the ecosystems and environmental management field— in terms of deepening understandings of value and particularly the historical constructedness of values— and the heritage management field, in terms of multiple value types and dimensions. It also provides opportunities for more effective, integrated and participatory management through bridging the two fields by promoting a common language and understanding of values.

Handling Editor: Leah Gibbs Abstract . Urban environments are heterogeneous landscapes of social and environmental features, with important consequences for human– nature entanglements, such as that of mosquito- borne disease. . Investigations into this intra- urban heterogeneity in mosquito dynamics find conflicting results, likely due to the complex socio- ecological interactions and the importance of place- based context. Integrative research, which synthesizes multiple disciplines and epistemologies, can place ecological results into their social context to explore these place- based differences and reveal novel solutions for mosquito- borne disease management. . Here, we develop an integrative approach to understanding spatial patterns of mosquito burdens in urban systems by combining entomological surveys, semi- structured interviews and sketch maps. We highlight this approach using a mixed- method study conducted in Bengaluru, India, a rapidly urbanizing city with a high burden of mosquito- borne disease. . Although we found no evidence for a difference in mosquito abundance across an urban gradient, there were differences in individuals' everyday experiences with mosquitoes. These differences were mediated by how individuals moved through outdoor space and their vulnerability to hazards in these spaces. . This example of integrative research illustrates what can be gained from the inclusion of multiple epistemologies, particularly for research in urban systems.

EVANS Et Al. | INTRODUCTION
Urban environments are heterogeneous landscapes of social and environmental features, with important consequences for human– nature interactions. Mosquito- borne disease transmission, for example, occurs at the intersection of specific conditions of the abiotic and biotic environment, mosquito vector and human host. Human populations in urban areas are at particular risk for certain mosquitoborne diseases, particularly viruses transmitted by mosquitoes in the Aedes genus, such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever ( Franklinos et al., 2019; Gubler, 2011 ) . This is due to high human population densities (Rose et al., 2020; Weaver & Reisen, 2010 ) , the adaptation of mosquito species to urban and domestic habitats ( Brown et al., 2014 ) , the abundance of larval habitat in anthropogenic landscapes (LaDeau et al., 2015) and urban microclimates conducive to mosquito and virus development (Murdock et al., 2017; Wimberly et al., 2020 ) . In fact, city dwellers make up a substantial portion of the over 3.5 billion people at risk of vector- borne diseases globally (World Health Organization, 2014 ) . Within a city, however, mosquito- borne disease risk is uneven, a result of the underlying heterogeneity of the socio- ecological landscape (Alberti, 2005; Romeo- Aznar et al., 2018 ) .
Recently, there has been an effort to understand these spatial patterns of mosquito- borne diseases in a city, and the causes of these patterns, so that limited vector control resources can be allocated efficiently (Stone et al., 2019 ) . The findings of these studies vary widely. Mosquito populations may be most abundant in either lower socio- economic neighbourhoods (LaDeau et al., 2013; Mulligan et al., 2015) or higher socio- economic neighbourhoods (Becker et al., 2014; Mulligan et al., 2015 ) . More frequent provision of piped water can increase (Lippi et al., 2018; Stewart- Ibarra et al., 2013) or decrease (Hayden et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2011) mosquito populations. The effect of climate is often nonlinear and dependent on regional climate trends ( Evans et al., 2019; Misslin et al., 2016; Murdock et al., 2017; Wimberly et al., 2020 ) . Clearly, many of these relationships depend on the specifics of the locale in question. Furthermore, environmental factors (e.g. hydrology, microclimate, host distributions) are the result of and interact with the socio- political context of the city (Parham et al., 2015; Santos- Vega et al., 2016 ) . For example, a study of water infrastructure and mosquito- borne disease in Ahmedabad, India found more malaria cases in areas with a low density of formal water infrastructure connections because informal water connections, which may not be well- maintained, led to high leakage and creation of habitat for mosquito vectors ( Subramanian et al., 2014 ) . Leaking connections also decreased water pressure for the whole network, influencing water storage patterns, and malaria, elsewhere in the city (Subramanian et al., 2014 ) . Understanding mosquito- borne disease in cities may therefore benefit from a place- based, integrative approach that situates ecological findings in the social context needed to properly address the complexity of a socio- ecological system ( Kinzig, 2001; Mayer, 2006 ) . .1 | Formulating an integrative approach to mosquito- borne disease
The study of mosquito- borne diseases is particularly plagued by a lack of interdisciplinary and integrative research, limiting the types of research questions that are typically asked and therefore the potential policy solutions considered. A review found that only 3% of the research on dengue and chikungunya, two Aedes- borne viruses, involves a social science approach (Reidpath et al., 2011) and the field rarely engages with critical social theory and prioritizes quantifiable metrics over qualitative analyses (Allotey et al., 2010; King, 2010 ) . In addition, critical social theory studies of mosquitoborne disease rarely include ecological or environmental pathways or data in their analysis of socio- political systems. Integrative research, ‘a process by which ideas, data and information, methods, tools, concepts, and/or theories are synthesized, connected, or blended’ (Repko, 2012 ) , is one methodology that combines the strengths of each of these approaches in a complementary way, without prioritizing one epistemological perspective over another ( Adams, 2007; MacMynowski, 2007 ) . Given the current state of the field of mosquito- borne disease, with its stark disciplinary boundaries, we propose that integrative research is one potential way to discover the novel research avenues needed to address mosquitoborne disease.
We base our conception of integrative research primarily in the principles put forth by Hirsch and Brosius (2013 ) , but which are shared with other formulations of integrative research (e.g. Miller et al., 2008; O’Rourke et al., 2019 ) . This framework embraces epistemological pluralism (e.g. multiple ways of knowing and evaluating the validity of knowledge claims) through the incorporation of quantitative and qualitative data and methodologies, as well as social and biophysical approaches to knowledge production. Viewed through a biophysical or ecological perspective, the relevant patterns are those in mosquito community diversity and abundance as they shift across an urban gradient. However, mosquito- borne disease transmission occurs at the intersection of mosquito vectors and human hosts, and so we must also examine patterns in individuals’ experiences with mosquitoes, questioning where, how and why they may encounter high mosquito burdens. The construction and management of nature in cities, and therefore potential mosquito habitat, is a direct consequence of existing socio- political processes and hierarchies of power, which often reproduce social inequalities in the resulting patterns in environmental amenities across a city (Gandy, 2014; Lawhon et al., 2014 ) . By focusing on power inequalities in an integrative analysis of mosquito- borne disease, we aim to identify not just the patterns in mosquito populations, but also the socio- political context that shapes these patterns.
Integrative research across biophysical and social boundaries, particularly in urban areas, is also grounded in the work of feminist scholars and geographers, who recognize the power dynamics inherent to the production of knowledge and offer alternatives to conventional scientific methods through hybrid and critical approaches to the natural sciences (Kwan, 2004; Lave, 2015 ) . In practice, this | 3
People and Nature
EVANS Et Al. means that we do not use quantitative data to validate qualitative results and do not view our own knowledge of the system as academic ‘experts’ over that of the community members. This is especially important given the power inequality between researcher and researched and the colonial history of discounting local knowledge in the field of tropical medicine.
Our study demonstrates how an integrative methodology can build on a purely ecological approach in the context of urbanization and mosquito- borne disease in a peri- urban area in southeast Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. This region has a recent history of rapid development and is the site of the city’s outward- facing urbanization into the previously rural periphery (Verma et al., 2017 ) . In addition, Bengaluru has experienced large outbreaks of dengue over the past decade (Balakrishnan et al., 2015 ) , and was a national hotspot for dengue during this study in 2019 (Yasmeen, 2019 ) . We demonstrate how the application of integrative research methods to urban ecological systems can be used to better understand people’s everyday experience with mosquitoes within the broader context of urbanization. Specifically, through this study, we address the following questions:
• How does the mosquito community’s composition and abundance shift across an urban gradient?
• How do changes in measured mosquito dynamics relate to perceptions of mosquito– human interactions?
• What additional insights can be revealed through an integrative approach that may be missed by a single discipline?
The first question is based primarily on an ecological approach, focusing on metrics of mosquito community diversity and abundance. The second question attempts to understand what these findings mean in the context of people’s interactions with mosquitoes by interpreting the results in the context of qualitative description of human– mosquito interactions. Finally, the third question reflects on what is learned by placing the results of the first two questions in the context of each other. | METHODS
Our methods include traditional ecological field methods of sampling mosquito communities and calculating metrics of abundance and species diversity. In addition, we attempt to place these metrics into the surrounding socio- political context through the simultaneous and interdependent consideration of qualitative data, including interviews and sketch maps. Using this mixed- methods approach, we investigate how the mosquito– human interactions change across an urban gradient as a consequence of changes to ecological and social environments. The following methods section is purposefully written in a narrative way, intertwining the entomological and social methods used, rather than presenting them as separate methods, in an effort to avoid presenting this work as a ‘view from nowhere’, implying that we are somehow neutral in the process (Haraway, 1988 ) . This is especially important given the mixed- methods approach used here because community members' interactions with us as researchers of mosquitoes influenced our discussions with them during formal interviews. It also makes it easier to recognize our own positionality in the production of this study, particularly our positions as outsiders to the residents of Sarjapur, and recognize the knowledge produced as situated ( Haraway, 1988 ) . .1 | Study area and site selection
Sarjapur is a peri- urban town located on the southeastern periphery of Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. Although historically an agricultural area, Sarjapur is currently (as of August 2021) the site of two planned special economic zones, hundred- acre campuses of two major information technology (IT) companies in the country. Currently under construction, these two developments are together projected to employ over 34,000 people (Jyothi, 2012 ) , and have spurred the development of new residential complexes in the area. Large tracts of land in the otherwise rural periphery of Sarjapur are being developed by housing developers to provide single- family homes in gated communities to the IT professionals immigrating to Sarjapur. These are planned communities whose public infrastructure (e.g. roads, pipes and vegetation) is managed by the housing developer. In the town of Sarjapur itself, high- density housing exists in the form of ‘sheet houses’ (one- story homes with corrugated tin roofs) on the outskirts and multi- story apartment buildings in town ( Figure 1 ) . It is in the context of this large- scale development that this study took place.
Within this region, we used a randomized site selection stratified across four land classes to select 16 sites. Land classes were chosen to represent four characteristic land types of the region based on their per cent of impervious surface and housing type, a qualitative measure of urbanization and an indicator of socioeconomic status (Nagendra et al., 2013 ) . Impervious surface was measured via an unsupervised land class classification of Sentinel 2 data from January to March 2019 (Frank et al., 2004, described in detail in Supporting Information S1) and approximated the amount of impervious surface in a 100 m radius surrounding each site. This resulted in the following land classes: rural (low impervious surface, no housing ) , village (moderate impervious surface, traditional housing ) , town (high impervious surface, traditional housing) and colony (moderate impervious surface, Western- style housing) ( Figure 1 ) . We divided Sarjapur into four blocks, corresponding to the East– West and North– South layout of the primary road system and associated development, and selected sites so that each block contained one site of each land class. Sites were at least 250 m from all other sites and over 1 km from sites of the same land class, except for town sites, which were clustered around the more highly developed centre. | People and Nature
EVANS Et Al. .2 | Data collection
Two researchers, MVE and SB, visited each site at least weekly from August to December 2019 to collect mosquito samples and conduct interviews. We visited each neighbourhood regularly and took part in many formal and informal conversations throughout these months. This allowed us to establish a presence at the site, rather than a one- time extractive sampling regime reminiscent of ‘parachute research’, when researchers ‘parachute in’ to collect samples without meaningfully interacting with local community members or researchers (Lancet Global Health, 2018 ) . This familiarity with residents created a rapport that helped to recruit interview participants and conduct in- depth interviews. Weekly visits allowed us to directly observe changes to the landscape and mosquito community described in the interviews at a fine temporal scale. We conducted entomological sampling via CDC light traps and oviposition traps at the centre of each site, with the permission from the resident or owner of that site. This person then served as our primary contact in the community for the interview portion of our study. As local experts, these community members also identified specific areas for trapping that were protected from disturbance and which they believed would successfully trap mosquitoes. Traps were placed in these identified areas, geolocated with a GPS device and were used as the centre of each 100 m site for subsequent analyses.
Oviposition traps consisted of a 1 L plastic container filled with ml nutrient infused water. Nutrient infused water was prepared by mixing 20 L water with 50 g of ground cat food and allowing the mixture to sit for 3 days at room temperature. The oviposition container had two holes 1 cm from the top to allow for water to overflow. We suspended a plastic cover 10 cm above the container to prevent rain and debris from entering the container. We installed two oviposition traps at approximately 1.5 m height to protect traps from livestock and 5 m apart at each site from 26 to 28 August 2019, and then sampled weekly for larvae until 11 November 2019, a total of 176 samples across the 16 sites. To sample, we filtered the contents of the trap through a fine- mesh filter. The water was returned FI G U R E 1 Study sites in Sarjapur, Karnataka, India.

EVANS Et Al. to the container and we refilled the container with infused water to replace any water lost due to drying. While sampling, we often took the opportunity to discuss the mosquitoes found in that week’s collection with residents and describe the different life stages of mosquitoes using collected samples in a clear container as an example. This provided context for our interviews with community members about mosquito habitat and its relation to water. For example, as one community member mentioned, ‘I had heard of [mosquito larvae in water ] , but I had not seen it with my own eyes. But you both proved to us that mosquitoes can emerge from water’. ( M01) All larvae and pupae were brought to the laboratory at Azim Premji University, where they were reared to adults, frozen at −40°C, and identified to species following (Christophers, 1933; Das et al., 1990; Tyagi et al., 2014 ) . Weekly abundances were averaged across the two oviposition traps. In instances where one trap failed during a week (e.g. tipped over or broken; 12/176 samples ) , we only included the working trap.
We also sampled monthly for adult mosquitoes using CDC light traps (John Hock Company and Arcturus Labs ) . We conducted this sampling once a month from September to November, trapping each site three times for a total of 48 trap nights. Traps were hung between 1.5 and 2 m from the ground in a covered area, to protect from rainfall. Lights were removed from the trap and traps were baited with approximately 1 kg of dry ice in an insulated plastic container hung directly next to the trap. Traps were placed in the morning and collected 24 hr later. Adult mosquitoes were frozen at −40°C and identified to species following (Christophers, 1933, Das et al., 1990, Tyagi et al., 2014 ) . As with oviposition sampling, we often shared the results of these adult catches with residents to spark discussion of mosquito burdens. At the end of the sampling period, these results were shared with community members through the distribution of a multilingual brochure as a form of strategic communication.
Throughout the entomological sampling period, we also undertook semi- structured interviews with community members at each site, except for the rural sites which did not have houses nearby. Interviews focused on household water access and individuals' interactions with mosquitoes. The full methods for this are described in Evans et al. (2020 ) . Briefly, we recruited 21 community members through a combination of spatial stratification across housing types, opportunistic sampling and snowball sampling (Stratford & Bradshaw, 2016 ) . Interviewees were adults over the age of 18 who managed their household’s water in some capacity. Due to low literacy rates, verbal consent was obtained prior to each interview and each interview was audio recorded, translated from Kannada or Hindi, when necessary, and transcribed. Interviews consisted of a semi- structured interview and sketch mapping exercise, and generally lasted 45 min. The interview focused on experiences with water access and perceptions of mosquito risk in relation to water and the environment. We asked participants to identify areas with high mosquito burden on satellite map imagery, referred to as sketch maps, and discuss the environmental causes of spatial patterns of mosquitoes. In some instances, community members accompanied us to these identified areas to discuss them in more detail.
Although our recruitment strategy was not specifically designed to yield a representative sample of the population, the combination of the heterogeneous nature of an urbanizing area and our site stratification across housing types resulted in a variety of sociodemographic characteristics among the participants. We spoke with women and 9 men, ranging in age from 19 to 75. Our participants included families resident to Sarjapur for multiple generations ( 12/21) as well as new migrants, which included people working in a variety of industries, such as IT, security, housekeeping and taxi driving. None of the colony residents, who all held graduate degrees and salaried jobs, were from Sarjapur. Due to this range of demographics, participants occupied different positions along various axes of power (e.g. capital, social, political, etc. ) , with consequences for their everyday experiences (Truelove, 2011 ) .

We conducted analyses of the entomological data, interview transcripts and georeferenced sketch maps simultaneously, allowing for the synthesis of observations across these different forms of knowledge. In practice, this meant pairing results from analyses of the entomological data to the transcribed interviews and sketch maps. By interpreting these results together, we noted where they did and did not agree and why. We investigated the effect of land class and impervious surface on adult mosquito diversity, adult mosquito abundance and oviposition trap abundances using regression in a Bayesian framework that accommodated random effects and non- normal distributions (McNeish, 2016 ) . We coded interview transcripts in Atlas.ti using a narrative approach to thematic analysis, which ‘treats interview data as accessing various stories or narratives through which people describe their worlds’ (Silverman, 2003 ) . Our coding process paid particular attention to community members' interactions with mosquitoes and their agency and control over these interactions. Sketch maps were manually georeferenced and were analysed alongside the interviews and entomological data using a process of grounded visualization (Knigge & Cope, 2006 ) . Results from the analysis of the entomological data and thematic analysis were interpreted in the context of finer scale spatial patterns denoted on the sketch maps and their placement in the satellite imagery depicting urbanization (e.g. maps of impervious surface and satellite imagery ) . We iteratively visualized sketch maps and maps of impervious surface that were linked to interview transcriptions and entomological data. If, for example, a particular area of a site was mentioned in an interview as having a characteristic that is predictive of mosquito burdens, we could connect that to the map of the site and that area’s location relative to the pattern of impervious surface at the site.
We calculated asymptotic estimates of Hill numbers from the adult mosquitoes sampled with CDC light traps for each site, aggregating across all three sampling months. Hill numbers are a set of | People and Nature
EVANS Et Al. diversity metrics that incorporate the number of species and their relative frequencies in a sample to estimate species diversity in units of ‘the equivalent number of equally abundant species that would be needed to give the same value of the diversity measured’ (Gotelli & Chao, 2013 ) . Hill numbers are defined following Equation (1 ) : where each species i in the total number of species (S) has relative abundance pi and the parameter q, referred to as the order, controls the sensitivity of the measure to the community’s evenness. For example, when q = 0, 0D is equivalent to species richness, and the relative weight given to common species increases with increasing orders. For this study we calculated 0D, 1D and 2D, corresponding to species richness, the exponential form of Shannon entropy and the inverse of the Simpson concentration (Chao, Chiu, & Jost, 2014 ) . Because the number of individuals differed greatly across sites, we used the asymptotic estimate of Hill numbers to compare these diversity metrics across these sites by extrapolating each metric to a theoretically infinite sample size following Chao, Gotelli, et al. (2014) using the iNEXT package ( Hsieh et al., 2016) in r v. 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2018 ) . We tested for an effect of land class and impervious surface on these metrics using generalized linear models, with the response variable transformed by subtracting 0.999 to better approximate a gamma distribution.
We used repeated- measures generalized linear mixed models to test for the effect of land class and impervious surface on adult mosquito abundance from the CDC light traps and abundance of Aedes mosquitoes from the oviposition traps. Because CDC light traps baited with dry ice have low- catch rates of anthropogenic Aedes species (Sriwichai et al., 2015 ) , we used oviposition traps specifically to target Aedes abundances in addition to the CDC light traps. The abundance of the CDC light traps was the abundance of all mosquitoes caught in the trap for each site × month combination. The abundance measure from the oviposition traps represented the mean across the two traps at each site for each weekly sample, rounding up to the nearest integer.
All statistical models were implemented in Stan via the brms package (Bürkner, 2017) in r v. 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2018 ) . We tested for potential spatial autocorrelation in our response variables using the Mantel test, finding no evidence of spatial autocorrelation (Table S1 ) . We inspected the trace plots and effective sample size and performed posterior predictive checks of each model to ensure convergence. Model formulas, priors and sampling settings are noted in Supporting Information S2. Model inference was implemented by calculating the Bayes factor (BF) for a full model compared to a null model. BFs are the ratio of the likelihood of the data given the null hypothesis to the likelihood of the data given the alternative hypothesis, in this case a hypothesized relationship between a covariate (e.g. land class or impervious surface) and the response variable ( Makowski et al., 2019 ) . This metric indicates the relative evidence for one model over another, given the data, with values above 1 corresponding to more evidence for the alternative hypothesis (e.g. BF = 2 indicates the data are twice as likely to occur under the alternative hypothesis than the null hypothesis ) . We follow the language suggested by Jarosz and Wiley (2014) in our reporting of BFs, and purposefully choose not to provide thresholds or benchmarks for BFs in an effort to reject the arbitrary categorization of statistical measures (Wasserstein et al., 2019 ) . .4 | Ethics statement

EVANS Et Al. one town and one rural site) only had Culex quinquefasciatus in their traps. Rural sites tended to have a higher species richness (0D) than sites in other land classes, however, the 95% CI overlapped for all land classes and there was little evidence in favour of an effect of land class on mosquito species richness (0D BF = 0.432, Figure 2 ) . Although all sites had high unevenness due to the dominance of Culex quinquefasciatus, there was strong evidence for an effect of land class on higher order Hill numbers (1D BF = 15.71; 2D BF = 48.22; Figure 2 ) , with higher diversity at rural sites than other land classes. In comparison, there was weak evidence for a relationship between impervious surface and all order of Hill numbers at the site level (0D BF = 1.12; 1D BF = 2.27; 2D BF = 2.73; Figure 2 ) .
Community members' interactions with mosquitoes described mosquitoes as a pest, most often in the form of bites and associated disease risk, but also mentioned finding larvae in household water storage or buzzing while sleeping. Experiences of mosquito diversity tended to focus on distinguishing Aedes mosquitoes from other mosquito genera within a site. Aedes mosquitoes are easily identified by their black and white markings and have been the focus of public education campaigns given their role in dengue and chikungunya transmission. However, in addition to visual traits (e.g. coloration, size, etc. ) , people also distinguished between mosquito species based on their activity times, noting the difference between diurnal and crepuscular mosquitoes and how this influenced their interactions with mosquitoes. One community member described the timing of her interactions with mosquitoes, demonstrating in- depth knowledge of mosquito behaviours:
The white- striped ones [referencing Aedes mosquitoes] would be biting us around now [late afternoon ] . It almost stops by the time the sun is down. The black ones [referencing Culex mosquitoes] bite in the night. ( H03)
Some residents mentioned their habit of closing the doors and windows to their home in the early evening to keep mosquitoes from entering. Culex quinquefasciatus is a crepuscular and nocturnal biter, and residents' descriptions of their interactions with mosquitoes align with the strong dominance of Culex quinquefasciatus found in the entomological surveys, although these mosquitoes are rarely mentioned in public health campaigns in Bengaluru. From a medical entomology perspective, diversity of species matters because it facilitates the transmission of multiple mosquito- borne diseases in a region. For people living with mosquitoes, diversity matters because it informs the measures that people can take to avoid mosquitoes. However, given that all sites were so highly dominated by the ‘domesticated’ Culex quinquefasciatus, there was little perception of the difference in mosquito diversity across sites as revealed by conventional ecological metrics (e.g. Hill numbers) that better incorporate rare species.

We found no evidence for a difference in overall adult abundance, as measured by CDC traps, or Aedes mosquito abundance, as measured by oviposition traps, across the urban gradient in Sarjapur. Statistical tests revealed no evidence for differences in adult mosquito abundance of all species caught via CDC traps across land class (BF = 0.434, Figure 3) or impervious surface (BF = 0.954, Figure 3 ) . Our oviposition traps targeted Aedes mosquitoes, catching three species: Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) (54.1% ) , Aedes albopictus (tiger mosquito) (43.1%) and Aedes vittatus (2.73% ) . In addition to Aedes mosquitoes, we also caught one Anopheles stephensi individual in the oviposition traps. We found little evidence for an effect of land class (BF = 0.647, Figure S1) or impervious surface (BF = 1.202, Figure S1) on Aedes abundance in oviposition traps.
However, peoples' experiences with mosquitoes differed greatly across neighbourhoods and did not always follow the differences in abundances that we saw from entomological sampling. One colony site had a relatively high abundance of mosquitoes compared to other sites, but the residents of this neighbourhood did not express concern about the mosquito situation given their ability to request fogging by the development manager or to simply avoid an area that they use for leisure (Figure 3 ) . In contrast, a site in town had much lower abundances, but fogging was infrequent, and residents could not avoid areas with high mosquitoes, given their reliance on these outdoor spaces for daily activities ( Figure 3 ) .
In the sketch mapping exercise, community members identified areas with high mosquito burdens and described their interactions with mosquitoes in those areas. These areas included places with drainage (11/21 ) , solid waste (13/21) or unmanaged vegetation ( 9/21 ) . The size of these areas ranged from 1 to 4,000 m2 with a median size of 72.3 m2. Many of these areas were close to community members' homes and unavoidable because residents conducted everyday tasks in these outdoor spaces. One woman identified a patch of vegetation next to her home with a high burden of mosquitoes that she could not avoid:
Yes, I can’t help it, I have to do my chores there. Yes, there are a lot of mosquitoes there. I have to wash the dishes there, clean my clothes also. ( L02)

Furthermore, some community members lived adjacent to open drains or waste disposal areas. One community member was dismayed by the proximity of his house to the sewage infrastructure because ‘the entire village’s filth comes in front of [his] house’ (K02 ) . These narratives demonstrate that individuals differed in their ability to mitigate exposure to mosquitoes by changing their behaviour or reducing mosquito abundances in outdoor spaces through vector control.
However, these fine- scale spatial differences were obscured when we aggregated impervious surface to the site level, defined by the surrounding 100 m, for use in our statistical models. When we used grounded visualization to consider the sketch maps in the context of remotely sensed impervious surface data and satellite imagery, we found that the areas identified by residents as having high mosquito burdens were areas of lower impervious surface than the surrounding landscape in 7 of 11 sites where residents marked mosquito habitat ( Figure 4 ) . However, there was no significant difference in mean impervious surface between the overall site mean and individually identified mosquito habitats, as determined by a paired t- test (t = 0.52522, df = 61, p- value = 0.6013 ) . This suggests that the spatial resolution of our site- level metric (30 m) was too coarse to identify these vegetative features which served as mosquito habitat within otherwise developed landscapes. | DISCUSSION
Changes to mosquito community composition and abundance across an urban gradient are one component of intra- urban heterogeneity in mosquito- borne disease burdens. However, it is also important to understand if these changes to the mosquito community translate to changes in peoples' experiences with mosquitoes, including both their perception of exposure and their stories of these encounters. We used an integrative approach to address these questions in parallel and a mixed- methods methodology that includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses and multiple epistemological viewpoints. We found that mosquito communities were more diverse in less urbanized, rural areas, but that the dominance of all communities by Culex quinquefasciatus meant that there was little perception of this difference across urban land classes by the population. In contrast, we found no evidence for a quantitative difference in mosquito abundance across an urban gradient, while qualitative analysis revealed that peoples' experiences with mosquitoes were mediated by how they interacted with outdoor spaces.
We found a difference in mosquito diversity across land classes, however, this difference did not translate into differences in individuals' experiences with mosquitoes. The mosquito community in Sarjapur was more diverse in rural land classes than in the village, town or colony land classes, which contained a nested subset of the full community. This homogenization of the mosquito community has been seen across other urbanization or development gradients ( Câmara et al., 2020; Loaiza et al., 2017) and is hypothesized to be due to changes in host composition (Goodman et al., 2018) microclimate (Townroe & Callaghan, 2014 ) , and larval habitat types (Wilke et al., 2019 ) . However, even rural areas had high abundances of Culex quinquefasciatus, which dominated the community at all land classes, and we found no evidence for a difference in total mosquito abundance across land class. Similarly, community members perceived little difference in mosquito abundance across the urban gradient of Sarjapur (on the scale of kilometres ) , although they did experience localized differences in mosquito burdens (on the scale of metres ) . Other studies of Culex species across urban gradients have found that the abundance of Culex species decreases with increasing urbanization (Field et al., 2019; Rochlin et al., 2016 ) , although these effects may depend on the larger regional context (Bowden et al., 2011 ) . Sarjapur is peri- urban, retaining characteristics of both agricultural and urbanized land classes, which may allow for similar abundances of Culex mosquitoes across the city.
In this study, mosquito abundance was similar across sites, but peoples' experiences of mosquito burdens differed, primarily due to individuals' relationships with outdoor spaces (Figure 3 ) . One difference was in an individual’s ability to shift their behaviour to avoid interacting with mosquitoes. For upper- class households living in colonies, outdoor space was primarily used for leisure or exercise, and individuals were able to change their schedule or avoid these areas when necessary. Other households, especially those without indoor plumbing, used outdoor space for everyday domestic tasks, and their ability to shift this schedule or access another space for this purpose was limited. These examples illustrate how individuals’ vulnerabilities differ in outdoor spaces, drawing attention to the intersection between characteristics of the physical space and an individual’s ability to avoid or mitigate hazards of that space, such as exposure FI G U R E 4 Areas of high mosquito intensity (yellow polygons) identified in sketch mapping exercise across three sites.

EVANS Et Al. to mosquito- borne disease (Watts & Bohle, 1993 ) . Viewing disease exposure within the context of vulnerability has proven a useful approach for placing spatial patterns in infectious diseases within their social, political and economic contexts (McLafferty, 2010 ) . Similarly, we found that individuals’ power to control an outdoor space, via fogging or avoiding the space, helped reduce feelings of vulnerability to mosquito- borne disease exposure; yet, this power was limited to wealthier, upper- class individuals living in colonies that could pay for services. Neighbourhoods that relied on municipal vector control reported limited success in requesting fogging or larval source management when needed. Our findings regarding the everyday differences in exposure and vulnerability to mosquitoes suggest that vulnerability may be a useful lens through which to consider inequalities in mosquito- borne disease burdens as well (Chang et al., 2014 ) .
One tension that arose through this study was the mismatch of spatial scale. Our study design focused on intra- urban heterogeneity at the scale of the city, defining each site as an area of 100 m radius. However, the sketch mapping exercise revealed that people conceptualized their experience with mosquitoes on a much finer spatial scale. Other studies that consider the lived experience of pathogenic landscapes have found that people visualize disease risk at fine spatial scales, and the scale of conceptualization can be related to often conflicting notions of responsibility and governance held by individuals and municipalities (Bempah et al., 2020; Nading, 2014; von Hedemann et al., 2015 ) . Between- household variation in exposure to mosquito bites can be on a magnitude of 100× difference (Guelbéogo et al., 2018 ) , and our findings suggest that high levels of spatial variation may characterize outdoor spaces as well. Furthermore, it has been shown that landscape heterogeneity is predictive of mosquito diversity, in addition to the dominant land class (Chaves et al., 2011 ) . Individuals also identified patches of vegetation within a matrix of higher impervious surface as mosquito habitat, which can act as refugia for mosquitoes (Hendy et al., 2020 ) . However, sketch mapping alone may not be able to identify all sources of mosquitoes in an area, as people’s movement and knowledge is constrained to areas they interact with. Top- down vector control campaigns conceptualize patterns in mosquito burdens at a coarser- spatial resolution, and across a large geographical area, such as a whole city. Given community members’ in- depth local knowledge of the environment ( Dickin et al., 2014; Nading, 2014 ) , they conceptualize mosquito burdens at a finer scale than top- down vector control campaigns. Our discussions with community members illustrated their knowledge of mosquito dynamics in their own neighbourhoods, a type of place- based knowledge that typifies a ‘bionomic’ approach to vector control that relies on ecological relationships to identify the most productive larval habitats (Kelly & Lezaun, 2013 ) . As has been suggested elsewhere (Bempah et al., 2020; Biehler et al., 2019; Dongus et al., 2007 ) , inclusion of local knowledge via participatory mapping and visualization activities in addition to standard entomological sampling is a promising opportunity for an alternative approach to vector control that includes place- based ecological knowledge.
This interdisciplinary study also contributes to the ‘conventional’ medical entomology understanding of mosquito- borne disease in Bengaluru. Most mosquitoes captured by our sampling method were of the Culex genus, which is the primary vector of lymphatic filariasis in India (NVBDCP, 2020 ) . Prior to national mass drug administration campaigns in the late 1990s, over 40% of the global cases of lymphatic filariasis were in India (Agrawal & Sashindran, 2006 ) . At present, prevalence rates are below 1% nationally (NVBDCP, 2020) and the disease is not endemic to Bengaluru (Sabesan et al., 2013 ) . Given the high abundances of Culex quinquefasciatus, however, local transmission remains possible if the parasite is introduced. We focused on Aedes mosquitoes in our study because the Bengaluru branch of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) targets Aedes- borne diseases. The mosquito abundances found in our study are similar to those found by the NVBDCP (Reegan et al., 2018, 2020) and incidence of dengue in Bengaluru was unusually high during this study period (Yasmeen, 2019 ) . Community engagement is a pillar of the NVBDCP national strategy (NVBDCP, 2020 ) , although this type of involvement was not mentioned in any interviews with community members in Sarjapur. In general, residents of Sarjapur exhibited high levels of knowledge regarding mosquito ecology and disease transmission and detailed knowledge of the surrounding environment but were not involved with decision making regarding vector control. Strengthening community- based vector control in the area by transferring decision making power about when and where to conduct vector control to these local experts could increase the efficacy of vector control programs by better targeting local hotspots of mosquito abundance.
Using an integrative approach allowed us to gain insight into differences that were not revealed by either method on its own. Through interviews, we expanded our conceptualization of risk from a quantity (e.g. the abundance of mosquitoes or the basic reproductive number) to one that incorporated peoples' lived experience with mosquitoes, highlighting a difference that was otherwise missed by our entomological analysis. The collection of mosquito samples via ecological sampling created a standardized, longitudinal dataset that was easily paired with remotely sensed imagery, to test quantitative hypotheses regarding urbanization and mosquito dynamics. The simultaneous collection of entomological and qualitative data also created opportunities for exploring the environment and everyday spaces with community members as they helped identify locations for sampling. Although these interactions occurred outside of the formal interview, we believe they enhanced our discussions with community members about the relationship between the environment and mosquitoes by providing tangible examples of these relationships, similar to other place- based interviewing methods ( Holton & Riley, 2014 ) . However, an integrative approach does have additional costs associated with it, particularly in the time and expertise needed to deploy multiple methodologies. While this does not require that an integrative approach must necessarily sacrifice depth for its epistemological breadth, it does suggest that providing structural and institutional support for facilitating research across disciplines, such as through collaborative, team- based science ( Leahey, 2016 ) , could reduce these costs and encourage more integrative research. | 11

EVANS Et Al.
The present lack of interdisciplinary approaches to mosquitoborne diseases is not simply coincidental, but a legacy of colonial medicine and the current landscape of funders that reproduces North– South colonial power dynamics (Green, 2019; Mitchell, 2002 ) . This contributes to an epistemological hierarchy that privileges medical and biological science research over social science research (Leach & Scoones, 2013 ) . This study challenges the politics inherent in knowledge production (King & Tadaki, 2018) by placing multiple types of knowledge in conversation, not opposition, and refusing to ‘validate’ narrative data with biophysical data. Other integrative fields, such as critical physical geography (Lave et al., 2014 ) , find that epistemological pluralism strengthens and contextualizes results from the individual disciplines. Our findings agree; here, the narrative analysis situates our entomological samples in the social context by clarifying for whom and how changes in mosquito abundance and diversity may translate to changes in disease risk.
We found that mosquito community diversity was higher in rural land classes than the other three land classes, but did not find evidence for a difference in mosquito abundance across the urban gradient of Sarjapur. However, semi- structured interviews revealed a difference in how individuals experienced mosquito burdens, particularly in their vulnerability to exposure. Individuals who used outdoor space for leisure activities were able to avoid areas during peak mosquito activity periods. Those who relied on outdoor space for domestic tasks had less flexibility and often could not avoid mosquitoes, placing themselves at higher exposure to bites. Using an integrative approach shed light on the relationship between ecological indices of diversity and abundance and peoples' everyday experience with mosquitoes, something that would not have been possible had we relied on a single discipline. An interdisciplinary approach was used as the foundation of the ‘Emerging Diseases in a Changing European Environment’ (EDEN) project (Randolph, 2006 ) , but is rarely applied in the Global South, where urbanization rates and climate change burdens are particularly high. While we are not suggesting that all ecological studies should be integrative, we found an integrative approach to be beneficial to the study of infectious disease in urban settings.

Handling Editor: Leah Gibbs Abstract . The cultural ecosystem services (CES) construct has evolved to accommodate multiple worldviews, knowledge systems and conceptualizations of nature and values, including relational and mental health values. . Cultural ecosystem services research and practice has mostly focused on cognitive ways of constructing and expressing intangible values of, and relationships with, nature. But our non- material relationships with nature are not exclusively cognitive: sensory and affective processes are fundamental to how we build, enact and experience these relationships. . Building on the core ideas of relational values, embodied experiences and connectedness with nature, we present a simple framework to explore the sensory, affective and cognitive dimensions of human– nature interactions, as well as the settings and activities that frame them. . We demonstrate its use in a case study in the Peruvian Andes, where we applied an inductive, exploratory approach to elicit personal imageries and imaginings related to nature, place and recreation. The narratives shared were rich with symbolism and personal sensory experiences, emotions and memories, which the interviewees linked with general assertions about people, place and nature. . We discuss the usefulness of such a perspective for CES research, and for human well- being, environmental justice and landscape management.
K E Y W O R D S cognition, cultural ecosystem services, emotion, environmental psychology, human– nature, sensation | INTRODUCTION
The ecosystem services framework, which represents how ecosystems contribute to human well- being through material and nonmaterial benefits, has strongly influenced environmental research, management and policy (Buijs et al., 2018; Droste et al., 2018; Flint et al., 2013; Gould et al., 2020; Kadykalo et al., 2019; Pascual et al., 2017 ) . Within this framework, well- being is used as a broad term to describe overall quality of life, happiness and satisfaction ( MA, 2005; Wyn et al., 2015) along a spectrum of inter- related | People and Nature
PRAMOVA et Al. dimensions such as physical and mental health, identity and belonging, sense of control and security, and learning and inspiration ( Russell et al., 2013 ) .
Among the different types of ecosystem services, such as provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural, the last type tries to capture the non- material ways people relate with ecosystems and nature more broadly (Chan et al., 2012; Gould et al., 2014, 2020 ) . Despite this ambitious premise, scientists have criticized cultural ecosystem services (CES) for being too reductionist (Gould et al., 2020; Leyshon, 2014 ) , for overlooking some non- instrumental values and pluralistic perceptions of nature (Comberti et al., 2015; Flint et al., 2013; James, 2016; Kirchhoff, 2019; Pascua et al., 2017 ) , for perpetuating the provider– recipient conceptualization of human– nature relationships (Buijs et al., 2018; Chan et al., 2012; Gould et al., 2014) and for using universalized representations detached from concrete relationships, geographies and embodied experiences ( Kolinjivadi, 2019; Raymond et al., 2013, 2018 ) .
Such criticisms have contributed to the evolution of the concepts of ecosystem services and CES (Droste et al., 2018; Gould et al., 2020 ) . The Intergovernmental Science- Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) proposes the framing ‘Nature's Contributions to People’ in an effort to accommodate multiple worldviews, knowledge systems and conceptualizations of nature and values, including relational values (Díaz et al., 2015; Kadykalo et al., 2019; Pascual et al., 2017 ) . People's relational values characterize the appropriateness of how they relate with nature and each other, including the principles, virtues and actions associated with a meaningful and good life (Chan et al., 2016) They include an ethics of care and appreciation that arise from these relationships ( Kleespies & Dierkes, 2020) and link closely to notions such as connectedness with nature and sense of place (the latter considered a cultural ecosystem service ) .
Connectedness with nature is a sustained awareness of the inter- relatedness between one's self and the rest of nature (Restall & Conrad, 2015; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . Sense of place is comprised of people's emotional and psychological relationships to a particular place and the symbolic meanings they assign to it (Krasny et al., 2014; Masterson et al., 2017; Tschakert et al., 2020 ) . It develops from direct and indirect individual experiences of different environments (Hausmann et al., 2016) but it is also socially constructed ( Stokowski, 2002 ) .
Cultural ecosystem services are inherently relational (Chan et al., 2011, 2012 ) , meaning they cannot exist as ‘products’ of nature independently of the people– nature relationships that create them (Chan et al., 2011; Fish et al., 2016 ) . As Fish et al. (2016, p. ) have aptly put it, CES can be better understood as ‘relational processes and entities that people actively create and express through interactions with ecosystems’. To better integrate human– nature interactions, Raymond et al. (2018) propose to transition CES towards the concept of embodied ecosystems. Embodied ecosystems are constituted by a web of relations between environment, culture, body and mind, which are situational and dynamical ( Raymond et al., 2018 ) .
Human– nature connections are thus produced through an interactivity of mind, body and environment (Cooke et al., 2016; Raymond et al., 2018; Wall- Reinius et al., 2019 ) . How we relate to nature is not an exclusively cognitive or aesthetic affair (Cooke et al., 2016; Ives et al., 2017; Nisbet et al., 2009; Tassin, 2000 ) . But this is what has been researched most prominently with CES, in addition to the prevailing quantification, spatial mapping and monetization of services such as recreation and scenic beauty (Chan et al., 2012; Gould et al., 2014 ) .
The affective dimension of human– nature interactions has been examined in research related to connectedness with nature (Zylstra et al., 2014) and measured with instruments such as the Emotional Affinity towards Nature (EAN; Kals et al., 1999 ) , the Nature Relatedness Scale (NRS; Nisbet et al., 2009) and the Love and Care for Nature Scale (LCN; Perkins, 2010 ) . Mental health and well- being studies have also focused on the affective (Anderson et al., 2018 ) , as well as human geography research, the latter within the field of emotional geographies exploring the interlinkages of emotions, space and society (Davidson et al., 2007; Davidson & Milligan, 2004; Thien, 2017 ) . Apart from neuroscience and psychology, the sensory dimension has been researched mostly in human geography, tourism and outdoors studies (Agapito et al., 2013; Robertson et al., 2015; Rodaway, 1994 ) , with some research related to human well- being, though there the focus has been predominantly on the visual sense ( Franco et al., 2017 ) .
With this paper, we hope to inspire more explorations of the sensory and affective dimensions of human– nature interactions and experiences of CES. Our main aim with this paper is to show the diversity of these interactions and experiences. We posit that exploring this diversity is central to understanding our relationship with nature (and essentially CES or non- material nature contributions to people; Daniel, 2001; Ives et al., 2017; Nisbet et al., 2009; Restall & Conrad, 2015; Russell et al., 2013 ) . Such an understanding can also have implications for human well- being, equity and landscape management.
We start by presenting a simple framework to explore the sensory, affective and cognitive dimensions of human– nature interactions and the settings and activities that frame them. We use the framework to analyse interviewee narratives from the Apurímac region of the Peruvian Andes where we elicited personal imageries and imaginings related to nature, place and recreation from rural and urban dwellers in the area, as well as tourists and environmental professionals. The non- material aspects of human– nature interactions are relatively understudied in countries of the Global South ( Buijs et al., 2018; Marczak & Sorokowski, 2018) and this is another gap that we hope to address. We proceed with discussing the relevance of such research for human well- being, equity and landscape management. | FRAMEWORK AND DEFINITIONS
The conceptualisations of nature and human– nature relationships are as diverse as the contexts and ontologies they stem | 353
People and Nature
PRAMOVA et Al. from (Flint et al., 2013; Milgin et al., 2020; Russell et al., 2013; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . We use the term nature to refer to living and non- living components of ecosystems within a range of pristine and human- modified environments, while recognizing that this concept is simplistic yet political, and can be incompatible with non- Western worldviews. Imageries and imaginings convey both personal realities and perceptions, they are shaped by cognitive, memory- related and emotional processes but also material expressions (Nogué & Wilbrand, 2017 ) . To analyse the mental imageries shared by our participants, we built a simple framework (Figure 1) inspired by the dimensions of place proposed by Switalski and Grêt- Regamey (2020 ) .
Our framework includes five elements: settings, activities and three dimensions of experience (sensory, cognitive and affective ) . Under ‘Settings’ we consider living and non- living ecosystem components (e.g. trees, mountains ) , broader scenic images (e.g. vastness of the landscape) and more ephemeral elements (e.g. gentle morning breeze, sunset light and colours) as used by Farber and Hall (2007 ) . We also included human- modified environments such as agro- ecosystems and landscapes containing buildings (Russell et al., 2013 ) .
With ‘Activities’, we consider metaphysical and intellectual interactions such as dreaming and imagining, inspired by ‘channels of experience’ (Russell et al., 2013 ) , as well as structured and unstructured physical interactions such as hiking, playing freely and swimming (Ives et al., 2017 ) .
To analyse nature experiences (illustrated in the top part of Figure 1 ) , we expand on the internal dimensions of experience (sensation, cognition and affect) from the Experiencing Nature Model of Linzmayer et al. (2014 ) , which is based on psychology and neurobiology literature (Barrett & Bliss- Moreau, 2009; Nelson, 2009; Schore, 2003 ) .
People respond to sensory stimulation from the external environment, but they also generate multi- sensory images within themselves (Agapito et al., 2013; Hirschman & Hoolbrook, 1982; MacInnis & Price, 1987 ) , which can be historical (recalling an event) or imagined (reconfiguring known sensory elements through imagination ) . Under ‘Sensory experiences’, we included experiences FI G U R E 1 Proposed framework for analysing experiences with non- human natures | People and Nature
PRAMOVA et Al. related to the five exteroceptive senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch) and those related to movement (kinaesthetic) and gravity (Tuan, 1974 ) . We also include perceptions formed by processing and interpreting external stimuli captured by our senses (Agapito et al., 2013; Goldstein & Brockmole, 2016; Ingold, 2000; Zimbardo et al., 2017 ) . Our internal realm determines our perceptions of the world, as these mechanisms of processing and interpretation are shaped by experience, knowledge, values and emotional states (Agapito et al., 2013; Wilson- Mendenhall & Barsalou, 2016; Zimbardo et al., 2012 ) .
It is impossible to separate the interdependent neural and psychological processes and delineate where perception stops and cognition begins (Leventhal & Scherer, 1987 ) . But for practical analysis, we consider ‘Cognitive experiences’ to be conceptual and reflective processes such as thinking (Clore & Schiller, 2016; Leventhal & Scherer, 1987 ) . These experiences involve values, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs and include memories, aesthetics, spiritual thoughts, nostalgia or inspiration (Farber & Hall, 2007; Ives et al., 2017; Williams & Harvey, 2001 ) .
‘Affective experiences’ include moods, feelings and emotions ( Clore & Schiller, 2016; Ortony et al., 1987; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . ‘Affect’ is a broad concept involving different kinds of valenced judgements from good/pleasant to bad/unpleasant (Clore et al., 1987; Clore & Schiller, 2016; Ortony et al., 1987 ) . All emotions are affective, but not all affective conditions are emotions (Clore et al., 1987; Ortony et al., 1987 ) . Emotions are internal, affective mental states that include dimensions of stimulus and valence, with emotional episodes being complex, structured events (Farber & Hall, 2007; Goldie, 2000; Lambie & Marcel, 2002; Ortony et al., 1987; Russell & Barrett, 1999 ) . Emotions are episodic because they occur following a specific event or stimulus and are structured because they form part of a narrative or sequence containing actions, events, thoughts and feelings (Goldie, 2000 ) . We consider feelings and emotions as affective experiences, recognizing that it is not practical to distinguish them.
Lastly, it is important to point out that sensation, emotion and cognition are integrated in experience and the internal processing thereof, making it difficult determine where one internal process ends and another begins. | METHODS
We interviewed 28 people in the city of Abancay (region of Apurimac, Peru) and two nearby villages (Ccorhuani and Llañocancha) in July . This research was part of a broader project on ecosystem services in the Mariño watershed in Apurimac which was implemented to address a gap in such research in the region. Abancay is located on the eastern slopes of the Andes. The landscape is dominated by small- scale family farms with mixed crops and livestock and natural grasslands, shrublands and montane forests. Near the city, the Ampay National Sanctuary is a protected mountain, with forests, lakes and a glacier reaching 5,180 m a.s.l., which attracts local and national tourists. Quechua Indigenous people represent a high proportion of the population (71% speak Quechua in Apurimac ) .
Interviewees were seven tourists (approached in the central square of the city and the bus station ) , seven urban dwellers (approached in the central square ) , seven rural dwellers (approached in the two villages) and seven professionals working on environmental issues (contacted through snowball sampling ) . Age range was 20– 51 years (half were <30 years old ) , with the tourists coming from Argentina, Colombia, Peru (Lima ) , Spain and Switzerland. Interviewees were selected to obtain a diversity of views rather than being representative of a population. We introduced ourselves, explained our research objective and asked people it they were willing to talk about their feelings and thoughts regarding places and landscapes of the region. If they agreed, we immediately proceeded with the interview after requesting verbal consent to record the discussion and explaining that data would be anonymized. Due to the nature of the research and its anonymized analysis and use, we considered verbal consent to be sufficient. The interviews took place in the main square of the city (with the tourists and urban dwellers ) , in the villages (with the rural dwellers) and in offices (with the professionals working on environmental issues ) . Our research protocol was approved by CIFOR Research Ethics Review Committee (reference FTR044 ) .
The first part of the interview was an ice- breaking discussion on the region, not used in the analysis (see Supporting Information 1 ) . To start this discussion, we asked the participants to elaborate on what kind of landscapes they considered special in general, what they liked about the Abancay region and to point out their favourite places (we used a map of the watershed with all participants except for the tourists, as this group was not very familiar with the region ) .
In the second part, which lasted about 30 min on average, interviewees were invited to choose five photographs from a set of 15 ( Figure 2) and to describe what they felt about each chosen place. We used an inductive, exploratory approach, minimizing issue framing as much as possible (see Supporting Information 1 ) . We recorded descriptions (called ‘statements’ hereafter ) .
We selected the 15 photographs to represent the diversity of sceneries or places in the region. All interviewee groups, apart from the tourists, knew the places of the photographs well. As for the tourists, they were travelling between Cusco and Lima and had stopped in Abancay because they had heard it was nice to discover. But even for those unfamiliar with the places in the photographs, exposure to photographs can itself be an experience of place and nature as it gives the viewer a sense of being in a particular environment (Hartig et al., 2011 ) , triggering cognitive, affective and behavioural responses (Ballew & Omoto, 2018; Hartig & Evans, 1993 ) .
All statements were transcribed and translated into English and edited (minor paraphrasing) for clarity. To code the statements, we listed all terms in the transcripts and removed stop words (i.e. words of no interest, e.g. ‘the’ ) . We used a ‘grounded theory’ approach in our content analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1994) to analyse the imageries of participants, based on the emergence of repeated concepts | 355
People and Nature
PRAMOVA et Al. and types of experiences, rather than using an a priori typology. We then classified each term into one of the five dimensions of our framework: sensory, cognitive and affective experiences, settings and activities (Figure 3 ) . If a term was ambiguous, we considered its context and if it had different meanings across the statements, it was replaced with a more precise term (e.g. ‘my life’ or ‘the cycle of life’ instead of ‘life’ ) . We grouped terms with similar meanings within categories that were created progressively during the analysis of statements. For cognitive and affective dimensions, which had many terms, grouping was done by first creating subcategories FI G U R E 2 The 15 pictures commented on by interviewees, sorted by decreasing number of times (n) they were selected
FI G U R E 3 Visual summary of the different analysis steps | People and Nature
PRAMOVA et Al. and then by merging subcategories into new terms (see Supporting Information 2 ) .
We then counted how many times each term occurred in each statement (Figure 3 ) . We used the counts of terms related to sensory, cognitive and affective dimensions to represent the statements in a ternary plot, classified into seven types depending on the dominant dimensions (e.g. sensory or cognitive- affective ) . We then analysed how categories co- occurred in the statements using correspondence analysis (Husson et al., 2017) to identify themes (defined as groups of co- occurring categories, essentially a grouping of the categories ) , which were illustrated with example statements. We used the R package corpus for text analysis (Huang & Perry, 2020 ) , ggtern for ternary plots (Hamilton, 2020) and FactoMineR for correspondence analysis (Husson et al., 2020 ) . A list of all the coded statements can be found in Supporting Information 3. | RESULTS
Almost all statements included at least one mention of a setting ( 99%) or a cognitive experience (96%; Figure 4 ) . More than half the statements reported a sensory (60%) or affective (55%) experience, whereas activities were mentioned infrequently (30% ) . The most frequent settings were abiotic (e.g. water, rock, snow) and vegetal ( e.g. trees, grasses ) . The most frequent activities were physical interactions (e.g. visiting a place or swimming ) .
For sensory experience, the sense of sight was dominant but our interviewees also talked about touch, hearing, sense of movement and gravity, despite the visual prompt of photographs that we used to start the discussion.
I like the smell of wet soil and the aromatic herbs. I like feeling the humidity of the forest. I like hearing the sounds of birds, insects, my steps, or the click of the camera. (statement #92)
We found a high diversity of cognitive experiences (Table 1 ) , the most frequent being connection to nature.
The water, the sky and the mountains remind me of similar places in other high mountain ecosystems. From my life experience, I am connected to this type of landscape. (statement #74)
Peace of mind was the most frequent category of affective experience, though participants also shared many other deep emotions and feelings.
I like the water when it is a little green and calm. I like the sound of the river and its colour, with the rocks and wind. Rivers take away everything you don't want. It gives me a lot of relaxation and I like it a lot. ( statement #16)
The canyon, the geological forms, the water, the shapes filled with thermal water, the stalagmites and stalactites, the plants: everything is wonderful in this place. It is absolute fun, I usually go to this place at night when no one is there, you can see the stars. It is the strongest contact I have ever had. The sound of the river is like a music that reaches your heart. Although one of my friends died there, it transmits a fear and a joy to me to be in the middle of the canyon. (statement #39 ) .
Almost half of the statements (54%) were dominated by one of sensory, cognitive or affective experiences (Figure 5 ) . Cognitive FI G U R E 4 The categories of the five dimensions found in the analysed statements (numbers indicate the percentage of statements included in this category) | 357
People and Nature
PRAMOVA et Al. statements (i.e. with more than two thirds of terms on experience relating to cognitive experiences) had the highest relative frequency ( 43% ) , with affective statements the least frequent (2%; see examples in Table 2 ) . For composite statements (where there was no clear dominance of one experience ) , sensory- affective ones were rare ( 4% ) , whereas others had similar frequency (13%– 15% ) .
The correspondence analysis showed the proximity between categories in the set of statements and, although the total variance explained by the two axes was only 15%, we were able to visually group categories into coherent themes (Figure 6; Table 3 ) . For example, the adventurous theme referred to statements that emphasized fear, challenge and gravity (i.e. the challenge of climbing mountains) and the naturalist theme included cognitive experiences about naturalness, care of/by nature and inquiry, as well as sensory experiences such as touch and smell. | DISCUSSION .1 | Nature experiences, connectedness and wellbeing
With this article, we examined personal imageries and imaginings related to nature and place experiences in the Abancay area of Apurimac, Peru. We analysed the verbal expressions of the imageries shared by our interviewees after being prompted to select and talk about places from photographs. Similar to Derrien & Stokowski's findings from analysing the discursive constructions of night sky experiences (2020 ) , the narratives shared were rich with symbolism and personal sensory experiences, emotions and memories, which the interviewees linked with general assertations about people, place and nature. Our main objective was to show the diversity of narratives and the importance of the sensory and the emotional in people's interactions and relationships with place and nature.
Personal sensory and emotional experiences of an environment are essential for shaping place meaning and place attachment, which build up the sense of place (Barendse et al., 2016; Clarke et al., 2018; Krasny et al., 2014 ) . Sensory and emotional experiences of and in nature are important for fostering connectedness with nature and overall well- being.
Many studies have demonstrated the restorative, stressreducing effects of nature (Berto, 2014; Bratman et al., 2019; Hartig et al., 2011; Russell et al., 2013 ) , as well as other physiological and psychological beneficial effects such as improved cardiovascular and immune functioning, improved cognitive abilities, increased life satisfaction, greater happiness and vitality, enhanced spiritual development and the reduction of several psychological symptoms (reviewed by Bowler et al., 2010; Bratman et al., 2019; Franco et al., 2017; Frumkin et al., 2017; Fuller et al., 2007; Haluza et al., 2014; Keniger et al., 2013; Russell et al., 2013 ) . Abiotic components (e.g. minerals, rocks, geomorphological and hydrological features ) , although overlooked in ecosystem assessments (Gray, 2011 ) , are also important for multiple aspects of well- being, ranging from physical and mental health to recreation, spiritual development, imagination and identity ( Kubalíková, 2020; Teff- Seker & Orenstein, 2019 ) . Many of the statements in our study also reflect this, adding to the call for a better integration of geodiversity with biodiversity in nature conservation and landscape management plans (Erikstad, 2013; Hjort et al., 2015 ) .

Various theories have addressed why and how nature experiences contribute to well- being and connectedness. These can be classified according to the emphasis placed on behavioural determinants: innate or evolutionary (e.g. the Biophilia hypothesis, environmental preference theories ) , cultural (e.g. responses to nature as a function of attitudes, beliefs and values shaped through learning and socialisation) or personal (e.g. unique individual traits, characteristics and experiences that shape the effects of other determinants; Hartig et al., 2011; Hartig & Evans, 1993 ) . Sensory engagement is again a prerequisite for positive affective and cognitive states to arise, as well as for connectedness FI G U R E 5 Ternary plot showing the distribution of statements according to the relative frequency of terms related to sensory, cognitive and affective experience

PRAMOVA et Al. ( Capaldi et al., 2017; Frumkin et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2020; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . It is not enough for people to spend time in nature, they also need to notice and appreciate nature to build connectedness and realize physiological, psychological and social benefits.
Finally, the effects of human– nature interactions on well- being may vary by socio- economic status, gender, preferences, personality, culture and held values, as well as the biophysical features of the setting and type of sensory input (Barendse et al., 2016; Bratman et al., 2019; Frumkin et al., 2017 ) , although our study was not designed to test these variations.
We did not examine differences in imageries and experiences based on social- demographic characteristics, environmental conditions, activities, personal capabilities, values or time spent in nature. Understanding these relationships is important for future research, which may also examine different contributions of nature to wellbeing and their perceived importance against these differentiating characteristics and contextual factors. This includes contributions to sense of place and identity. .2 | Capabilities and equity
Values and nature experiences influence how CES contribute to well- being (Russell et al., 2013) as do capabilities (Fischer & Eastwood, 2016 ) . Capabilities refer to the personal, social and environmental factors that determine what people are able to do and be, such as physical and financial capabilities, accessibility, skills and knowledge, perceived rights and confidence.
Elwell et al. (2020) illustrate this in a study with natural resourcedependent communities in Chile. These communities perceived CES, especially those related to scenic beauty, biodiversity and space to recreate, as more important to well- being than some of the provisioning services on which they depended. They also advocated for small- scale tourism and conservation to enhance these services. The authors conclude that, due to their reliance on provisioning services, these communities spent more time in nature, and this allowed them to appreciate the outdoors as a place that meets needs beyond the material. In contrast, wage earners appreciated the well- being benefits of CES but less so than resource- dependent communities. This could be because they felt less able to access ecosystems to meet such needs or because they spent less time in nature and thus did not directly experience ecosystems as spiritual or recreation places.
Although looking at a different but still related variable, a study on modernization and emotional connectedness to nature in Kenya found that more traditional lifestyles were negatively related to connectedness (Marczak & Sorokowski, 2018 ) . In this study, the constant nature contact of Meru communities in remote villages and pastoralist settlements was marked by dangerous wild animals, dry season extreme heat and water shortages, monsoon torrential rains and other hardships and risks. The authors explain their results with these contextual and environmental influences (less remote communities spent time in nature in a leisure context while the nature experience of remote communities was marked by hardships ) . Local and global dynamics continuously shape capabilities and context. The coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic, for example, affected human– nature interactions through three inter- related pathways: changes in (a) opportunity (e.g. time available for going out in nature, increase in bird populations ) , (b) capability ( e.g. psychological and physical capacity to engage with nature, which can be affected by stress, illness or government regulations) and (c) motivation (e.g. inclination towards outdoor activities; Soga et al., 2021 ) .

Adventurous
#58. I feel fear in front of the greatness of the snowy mountains. It gives me a challenge, I'm here and I want to try to get there. With patience and perseverance, you can do whatever you want. Whoever reaches the summit conquers wisdom and patience. If the path is infinite you have to make your strength infinite
Distressed
#9. I see the little snow that remains and I see the grasses. This reminds the past but I see unpleasant changes and it makes me sad to think that the snowy mountains have lost their snow. But nevertheless the place is spectacular along the way. I am sad that snow is missing
Naturalist

Qualitative studies that focus on narratives and on internal experiences can illuminate the diversity of human– nature interactions but also shed light on capabilities. They can help to capture the contextspecific, place- based and relational processes involved in the production of well- being benefits from these interactions (McCarter et al., 2018; Woodhouse et al., 2015 ) , something which cannot be elicited through quantitative approaches (Gould et al., 2020 ) . They also give a voice to the less powerful, which is important for more equitable landscape management.
An environmental justice and equity analysis examines the fairness of processes and (mal ) distribution of harms and opportunities related to the environment, with a special focus on power, race and class (Sze & London, 2008 ) . Places, the backbone of CES, are particularly important because they affect people's well- being and any action that involves places can be a source of justice or injustice (Higgins- Desbiolles et al., 2013 ) . Such issues are pertinent for Abancay, as the region presents great opportunities for eco- tourism and conservation, with developments already underway (Valdivia Díaz, 2017; Valle Díaz, 2020; Vallet et al., 2020 ) .
Eco- tourism, a popular use of CES, can impact sense of place and human– nature relationships through branding and place- making ( Mostafanezhad & Norum, 2019; Swyngedouw, 2010) or through power (e.g. local government) establishing landscape meanings and rules (Masterson et al., 2017 ) . Place- making in tourism happens by assigning sensations and emotions to particular places, where specific interactions between environment, human practices, sensations and emotions are prioritized and used to shape tourist experiences (Metro- Roland & Soica, 2019; Wall- Reinius et al., 2019 ) . If only certain emotions are prioritized, there is a danger of invalidating, or even erasing, other emotions, lived experiences and human– nature interactions (especially those of local inhabitants ) . The same can happen with conservation initiatives.
Incorporating the diversity of lived experiences of both local communities and visitors, which narratives of sensory, emotional and cognitive experiences can help illuminate, is an opportunity to negotiate contested views of nature, CES and well- being, for a more inclusive ecosystem and landscape governance. .3 | Engaging with the diversity of experiences
Different approaches are suggested for incorporating the diversity of lived experiences. The biocultural approach to conservation and landscape management advocates for capturing the whole diversity of place- based human– nature interactions and relational understandings of well- being, with an emphasis on the cultural practices that influence and are influenced by the land- and seascapes in question ( McCarter et al., 2018; Sterling et al., 2017 ) . Non- prescriptive human well- being frameworks that allow for subjective perceptions and indicators can help to explore the benefits and trade- offs of different conservation and land use strategies more holistically (Beauchamp et al., 2018; Wali et al., 2017 ) . Along these lines, viewsheds, soundscapes and sense of place have been proposed as boundary concepts for fostering communication between stakeholders in the management of national parks in South Africa (Barendse et al., 2016 ) . Raymond et al. (2013) propose the systematic consideration of multiple metaphors of human– nature relationships for a more deliberative approach to ecosystem research and management, while Jackson and Palmer (2015) advocate for including socio- ecological practices as services in the ecosystem services framework. ‘Socio- ecological practices as services’ acknowledges human cognition, care and labour, as well as non- human agency, in shaping and producing the ecosystems which are the source of multiple other benefits.
Engaging with the entire spectrum of the lived experience— cognitions, emotions and sensations— will lead to a greater understanding of people– place and people– nature relationships (Davidson et al., 2007; Masterson et al., 2017; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . This can inform the design of interventions that are beneficial to both human well- being and biodiversity (Petersen et al., 2019; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . At the very local scale, even small interventions are important for improving the accessibility of CES and subsequently human well- being. These can be, for example, hedges of native trees and shrubs, edible forest gardens and simple infrastructure such as a bench highlighting a lookout point for observing nature (Elwell et al., 2020 ) . Such interventions have been popping up in urban areas, but much remains to be done in ensuring access for people with different capabilities and from different socio- economic backgrounds (Andersson et al., 2014; Elwell et al., 2020; Zylstra et al., 2014 ) . | CONCLUSION
With this article, we wanted to demonstrate the diversity of imageries of human– nature interactions and experiences and how it goes beyond the cognitive aspects usually examined in CES research. Exploring how people enact, experience and articulate their relationship with place and nature is important for more equitable environmental management and landscape planning, and for biodiversity conservation and human well- being. Emotions and sensations are fundamental aspects of these relationships and should be valued along with cognitions such as attitudes, beliefs and values. Qualitative, narrative approaches are particularly suited for revealing these aspects, as well as the contextualised links between CES and well- being.

Abstract . Alien species can be damaging to native biodiversity, human well- being and the economy. Identifying the complete range of impacts they cause, and the ways that these impacts are connected, may inform the prioritisation of management actions to mitigate impacts. . Using datasets on the biodiversity impacts and monetary costs (damage and management costs) of alien birds, we aimed to establish whether species with the most severe biodiversity impacts also had the highest costs; whether types of biodiversity impact were associated with high costs; and whether specific factors associated with alien species are linked to both damaging biodiversity impacts and high costs. . We identified a positive relationship between a specific type of biodiversity impact (predation) and costs, possibly because predation by alien birds can be severely damaging to native species and therefore attracts management actions. However, predation impacts are likely to occur more frequently and to be easier to identify than some other impact mechanisms such as hybridisation and transmission of diseases, and they are therefore likely to be more frequently managed and hence to have costs. . We identified a specific species characteristic (generalism) to be associated with severe biodiversity impacts and high costs, probably because generalist species have greater opportunity to cause impacts, whether they be on biodiversity or the economy, or both. We also found widely distributed alien birds to be associated with high costs, probably because these species also have greater opportunity to cause impacts.

EVANS et al. | INTRODUCTION
A species is considered to be alien when it has been introduced by people to regions of the world where it would not naturally occur ( Blackburn et al., 2011 ) . If an alien species has damaging impacts, it is considered to be invasive (IUCN, 2023 ) . Invasive alien species are one of the five main causes of declining biodiversity across the globe, and they can adversely affect human well- being, in particular by hindering economic development and compromising human health (Díaz et al., 2019 ) .
There are over 400 alien bird species with self- sustaining populations worldwide (Dyer et al., 2017 ) , and some have unwanted impacts on nature and people (Evans et al., 2016, 2020 ) . Impacts that affect nature include competition with native species for resources and predation of native species as a source of food (MartinAlbarracin et al., 2015 ) . Impacts that affect people include the consumption of agricultural crops, damage to aircraft caused by bird strikes at airports, and fouling of public buildings and amenity spaces ( Brochier et al., 2010 ) . Damage and management costs associated with these impacts can be substantial. For example, in 2006/07, the Western Australian Government spent AU$2.45 million on a surveillance, research and control programme for common starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris ) , which feed on soft fruit and are a threat to agriculture across the region (Roberts, 2006 ) .
Comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics of these impacts is required to inform the prioritisation of management actions to deal with the most damaging alien species (Caffrey et al., 2014 ) . Indeed, at the Fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 15 ) , nations adopted 23 global targets for 2030, including Target 6 which requires the prioritisation of actions towards alien species with the most severe impacts (CBD Secretariat, 2022 ) . Two frameworks and a database have recently been developed which aim to improve understanding of the biodiversity and socio- economic impacts of alien species, by enabling impact data to be categorised, quantified and standardised in a manner that facilitates direct comparisons of impacts by their severity and type. These are the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) (Blackburn et al., 2014 ) , the Socio- economic Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (SEICAT) ( Bacher et al., 2018) and the InvaCost database (Diagne, Leroy, Gozlan, Vaissière, Assailly, et al., 2020 ) . Under EICAT, the environmental impacts of alien species are categorised by their type using impact mechanisms (e.g. competition with native species and predation of native species) and by their severity using five impact categories (Minimal Concern [MC ] , Minor [MN ] , Moderate [MO ] , Major [ MR] and Massive [MV] ) . Published guidelines (IUCN, 2020) provide a series of semi- quantitative impact scenarios which guide the assessment process. SEICAT uses data on the socio- economic impacts of alien species to assess how these impacts affect the well- being of people. Developed in tandem with EICAT, it adopts the same five impact categories (MC– MV ) . InvaCost is a living, publicly available database that provides a systematic, standardised methodology for the collection and treatment of data on the economic costs of alien species, enabling historical cost data in different currencies to be transformed to current, standardised values (Diagne, Leroy, Gozlan, Vaissière, Nuninger, et al., 2020 ) .
EICAT has been used to undertake assessments of the biodiversity impacts of alien species from a range of taxonomic groups such as Acacia species (Jansen & Kumschick, 2022 ) , rabbits and hares ( Allmert et al., 2022) and birds (Evans et al., 2016 ) . The results of the latter study informed research to identify factors that influence the severity of alien bird impacts (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) and factors that make native birds vulnerable to these impacts (Evans et al., 2021 ) . SEICAT has been used to improve understanding of the ways in which alien species from a range of taxonomic groups affect human well- being, including for example, marine fishes in the Mediterranean (Galanidi et al., 2018 ) , gastropods in South Africa ( Kesner & Kumschick, 2018) and birds globally (Evans et al., 2020 ) . InvaCost has been used to describe and analyse the global economic costs associated with specific groups of alien species such as ants ( Angulo et al., 2022 ) , fish (Haubrock et al., 2022) and birds (Evans et al., n.d. ) , and to demonstrate that inaction to manage the impacts of alien species can result in spiralling costs (Ahmed et al., 2022 ) . It has also been used to describe and analyse costs occurring in specific regions of the world (studies on costs have been published for countries and 8 regions to date) (InvaCost, 2022 ) , and to demonstrate that the global costs associated with alien species are grossly underestimated (Diagne et al., 2021 ) .
Thus, EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost provide useful datasets on alien species impacts. However, they each consider specific types of impact (biodiversity, human well- being and economic cost, respectively ) , so when used individually they do not provide information on the complete range of impacts caused by alien species.

EVANS et al. more comprehensive understanding of these impacts. Indeed, identifying the complete range of biodiversity and socio- economic impacts caused by an alien species may better inform the prioritisation of management actions to mitigate its impacts.
Combining data from EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost may also improve our knowledge of the links between biodiversity impacts and economic costs. Identifying statistical links may enable the prediction of biodiversity impacts or economic costs for species lacking data on either. Furthermore, as biodiversity and human well- being are linked through the provision of ecosystem services ( Díaz et al., 2019 ) , identifying connections between biodiversity and socio- economic impacts may inform a more holistic approach to the management of alien species.
To our knowledge, only a small number of studies have investigated relationships between the biodiversity impacts and socioeconomic impacts of alien birds, and all at a regional scale, either in Europe (Kumschick & Nentwig, 2010; Kumschick et al., 2013, 2015; Shirley & Kark, 2009) or Australia (Evans et al., 2014 ) . All adopted a similar method, undertaking a literature review to identify impacts and using a scoring system (Nentwig et al., 2010) to rank impacts by their severity and their type using a series of impact categories (e.g. environmental, economic and human health ) . None of these studies undertook any formal analysis using standardised data on economic costs. The results of these regional- scale studies indicate that some alien bird species are associated with both biodiversity impacts and socio- economic impacts. Indeed, alien bird species in Europe with damaging socio- economic impacts were found to also have damaging biodiversity impacts, although some alien bird species with minor socio- economic impacts also tended to have damaging biodiversity impacts (Kumschick et al., 2015 ) .
Three of these studies identified traits associated with alien birds that may influence the severity of their biodiversity and socioeconomic impacts (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013; Shirley & Kark, 2009 ) , and a further study analysed and identified traits associated with more severe biodiversity impacts (at the global scale) but did not undertake analysis on socio- economic impacts (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) (see Table 1 for a summary of these studies ) . At the regional scale (Europe and Australia ) , traits associated with generalism; e.g. the number of different habitats a species occupies (habitat breadth) or the number of different dietary items a species consumes (diet breadth) are consistently correlated with both more severe biodiversity impacts and socio- economic impacts, whilst traits associated with resource use (e.g. body mass and flockforming species) are less conclusive (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013; Shirley & Kark, 2009 ) . They also indicate that the influence of some traits has been tested for biodiversity impacts (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) but not for socio- economic impacts, including for example, several traits associated with the distribution of alien birds, such as alien range size (Table 1 ) .
Here, we aim to use EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost data to identify specific types of impacts and factors associated with alien birds that link their biodiversity impacts with their economic costs at the global scale. Based on the results of past studies, we expect to find that the more severe the biodiversity impact caused by an alien bird species, the greater its economic costs will be (hypothesis 1 ) . Because some impact mechanisms (particularly predation) are associated with severe biodiversity impacts (Evans, 2021; Evans et al., 2016 ) , we expect to find that these impact mechanisms are also associated with higher economic costs (hypothesis 2 ) . Finally, also based on the results of past studies, we expect to find TA B LE 1 Results of published studies that have examined the influence of variables on the severity of the biodiversity impacts and socioeconomic impacts of alien birds.

EVANS et al. that specific factors such as species traits (e.g. body mass) are associated with both severe biodiversity impacts and high economic costs (hypothesis 3 ) . | MATERIALS AND METHODS .1 | Data on biodiversity impacts
Data on biodiversity impacts were taken from published global EICAT assessments (Evans et al., 2016) and additional unpublished assessments completed in 2021, which were undertaken in accordance with the EICAT guidelines (IUCN, 2020 ) . From these EICAT assessments, we took each alien bird species' most severe impact score (MC– MV) and the mechanism associated with this impact ( competition, predation, hybridisation etc. ) . For some of these species, no impact data were available to assess their impacts (i.e. no data describing their impacts were found during online literature reviews completed for the EICAT assessments ) . These species were categorised as being ‘data deficient’ (DD) under EICAT. In total, our dataset included 121 alien bird species with an EICAT score ( MC– MV) and 296 species that were DD (417 species in total) (see Table S1, Supporting Information ) . We excluded the feral pigeon ( Columba livia) from our analysis as the true alien range of this species is unknown. See Figure S1 for a flowchart of the methods. .2 | Data on economic costs
The total costs caused by each alien bird species were calculated by summing each available economic cost record for an alien bird species from the InvaCost database (v4.1 ) . These records include costs associated with damage (e.g. to agriculture) and management (e.g. the eradication of an alien bird population due to its damaging biodiversity impacts ) . All costs have been converted in the database to US$ (2017 value ) . For complete information on InvaCost methodology and calculation methods, see Leroy et al. (2022 ) . There are many ‘costs’ associated with both the biodiversity and socio- economic impacts of alien species that are difficult to monetise (e.g. the extinction of a native bird species caused by a predatory alien bird species on an island, which results in a direct decline in biodiversity and may affect local communities by causing negative perceptions of their surrounding environment ) . Thus, our analysis is of monetary costs ( and hereafter, costs are referred to as ‘monetary costs’ ) .
We then reviewed a global alien bird SEICAT assessment (Evans et al., 2020) to gather any additional information on monetary costs caused by alien birds that were not in the InvaCost database. SEICAT assessments incorporate a literature review for each alien species to identify data describing its socio- economic impacts, including cost data (where available ) . Thus, we did not use the actual published SEICAT impact scores (MC– MV) for each alien bird species but rather reviewed the literature gathered on socio- economic impacts during the SEICAT assessments to identify any data on costs.
The monetary costs of alien bird species with weak socioeconomic impacts may not have been calculated or reported because they are likely to be low (and therefore perceived not to be an issue of concern ) . Indeed, invasion biology research tends to focus on species with the most severe impacts (Pyšek et al., 2008 ) . Therefore, to identify alien bird species with low monetary costs, where an alien bird SEICAT assessment identified literature indicating that the monetary costs of an alien bird species were likely to be negligible, we assigned a value of US$0 to these species as a proxy for their actual monetary costs. For example, the little owl (Athene noctua) has been introduced to New Zealand with the aim of controlling other introduced bird species, where it appears to have few negative socio- economic impacts (and associated costs) (New Zealand Birds Online, 2013 ) ; this species was assigned a US$0 cost value (see Table S2, Supporting Information, for species allocated a US$0 cost value ) . We treated all alien bird species that were categorised as DD under SEICAT (i.e. species for which no data on socio- economic impacts were identified during SEICAT assessments) as being DD under InvaCost (i.e. species for which no data on monetary costs were available ) . In total, our dataset included 40 species with cost data (either an actual cost (22 species) or a $0 cost value (18 species ) ) and 378 species that were DD for costs (total = 417 species; the same 417 species assessed under EICAT) (see Table S1, Figure S1, Supporting Information ) .
Our cost calculations included costs associated with the control or eradication of alien bird species, even if these actions were undertaken to manage biodiversity impacts. We recognise that there is a direct link between biodiversity impact and monetary cost in these cases. Nevertheless, some alien bird species may have negligible biodiversity impacts that do not warrant control or eradication. Further, some alien species may be easier (and less costly) to control than others (e.g. flightless alien bird species such as the weka, or bird species with small alien populations ) . Therefore, control and eradication costs are likely to vary depending on the characteristics of the targeted alien bird species and the severity of its biodiversity impacts.
Several of the 22 species with costs had either damage or management costs, but not both. This meant that the dataset of species was too small to undertake separate analysis of damage costs and management costs. We therefore combined damage and management costs for each species for the analysis.
Given the small number of alien bird species in our dataset, we acknowledge that the cost data we identified is unlikely to capture the complete range of monetary costs caused by alien birds. Indeed, our dataset is opportunistic, as the economic costs of alien species are not systematically studied, and therefore InvaCost only captures information on the costs of species that happen to be studied. Thus, our dataset represents a lower bound of costs associated with alien birds. .3 | Data on factors that may drive biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
We identified five broad hypotheses regarding the ways in which alien birds may cause biodiversity impacts and monetary costs , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [14/11/2023 ] .

People and Nature
EVANS et al. ( H1– H5; Table 2 ) . We collected data on a series of predictor variables associated with each of these hypotheses that are linked to specific factors associated with alien bird species (Table 2 ) . See Data Sources for the sources of data for predictor variables. See Table S3, Supporting Information, for variable descriptions. .4 | Analysis— Linking severe biodiversity impacts with monetary costs; linking types of biodiversity impact with monetary costs
Our analysis of links between biodiversity impacts and monetary costs was restricted to species for which we had both an EICAT score and a cost value (40 species ) . Species categorised as DD under EICAT and/or InvaCost were excluded. Due to small sample sizes for certain EICAT impact categories (MR impacts, n = 3; MV impacts, n = 1 ) , we converted EICAT data into a two- level variable: ‘less severe’ impacts (MC and MN impacts ) , n = 23 species, and ‘more severe’ impacts (MO, MR and MV impacts ) , n = 17 species. This divided impact severity such that ‘less severe’ impacts were those considered to be negligible (MC) or to affect the fitness of individuals of a native species (MN impacts ) , and ‘more severe’ impacts were those considered to be ‘harmful’ under EICAT because they cause declining populations of native species (MO impacts) and local or global species extinctions (MR and MV impacts, respectively ) . Costs were analysed as a continuous variable (US$ ) .
As our dataset considers traits known to be influenced by phylogeny (e.g. body mass) and specific orders and families of alien birds are associated with specific types of impact (e.g. Anatidae with hybridisation ) , we expected our analysis to be influenced by phylogenetic autocorrelation. Following Evans et al. (2021 ) , we used Birdt ree.org (http://birdt ree.org/) to download 100 randomly selected phylogenetic trees incorporating the 40 species in our dataset. We used phylo.d (Fritz & Purvis, 2010) in the Caper package in R (Orme et al., 2018) to calculate the D statistic (a measure of phylogenetic signal in a dataset) for each phylogenetic tree. We identified phylogenetic signal in severity of impact (average D = 0.4) with a low probability of D resulting from no phylogenetic structure (average p = 0.03) or Brownian phylogenetic structure ( average p = 0.2 ) . To address this, we analysed our dataset using phylogenetic linear regression (regression analysis incorporating phylogenetic methods) (Revell, 2010) (the phylolm package in R) ( Tung Ho & Ané, 2014) to account for potential phylogenetic relatedness among species.
TA B LE 2 Proposed hypotheses and their associated factors and variables.
Hypothesis
Factor
Predictor variable
H1: Resource use. Alien species with greater per capita resource requirements place greater demands on the environment, which may affect native biodiversity (e.g. overgrazing of native vegetation) or socio- economic interests (e.g. consumption of agricultural crops)
Size
V1: Body mass
Whether alien bird species are solitary or flock- forming
V2: Sociality
H2: Generalism. Alien species with broad niches will have greater opportunity to cause impacts. For example, those occupying a wide range of habitats are likely to interact with a more diverse range of native species and assets of value to humans, increasing the chances that some of their impacts will be damaging to biodiversity or the economy. Habitat generalist alien birds have been found to have more severe impacts in Europe (Shirley & Kark, 2009) and Australia (Evans et al., 2014 ) , and diet generalist alien birds have more severe impacts in Europe (Evans et al., 2014)
Habitat generalism
V3: Habitat breadth
Diet generalism
V4: Diet breadth
The size of an alien bird species native range (as an indicator of the breadth of environmental conditions a species may tolerate)
V5: Native range size
H3: Dietary preference. Specific diets of alien bird species are associated with specific types of impacts. For example, predatory alien birds ( that eat animal matter) have been deliberately introduced to islands to control pest species (e.g. rats and insects) where they tend to have few reported economic impacts (perhaps because there are fewer opportunities for such impacts on islands) (Evans et al., 2020 ) . However, they have reported biodiversity impacts on these islands ( e.g. by preying on native birds) (Evans, 2021 ) . Frugivorous alien birds may damage soft fruit, whilst seed- eating alien birds may damage crops ( economic impacts ) , and both fruit and seed- eating alien birds may spread the seeds of alien plants (a biodiversity impact)
Diet preference (animal matter)
V6: The proportion of a species' diet comprising animal matter
Diet preference (seeds and fruit)
V7: The proportion of a species' diet comprising seeds and fruit
H4: Distribution. Alien species that have more time to establish and spread may have more damaging impacts; those that are more widespread may have more damaging impacts, because they are likely to be more abundant and because they may have greater opportunity to cause impacts across the different types of habitats that they occupy
The length of time a species has been present as an alien
V8: Alien residence time
The size of a species alien range
V9: Alien range size
H5: Ecological flexibility. Alien species that are better able to adapt to their new environment are more likely to thrive and cause impacts

EVANS et al.
We first compared the association between the severity of biodiversity impacts and monetary costs (phylogenetic linear regression using the phylolm package [and the phylolm function ] ) (Tung Ho & Ané, 2014 ) , with biodiversity impact as a two- level predictor variable as previously described (‘less severe’ impacts and ‘more severe’ impacts ) , and costs as a continuous response variable ) . We then compared the association between different types of biodiversity impacts (using EICAT impact mechanism categories, e.g. competition, predation) and monetary costs. We divided each EICAT impact mechanism into a two- level predictor variable (e.g. competition impact = ‘1’, no competition impact = ‘0’ ) . Competition and predation impacts were analysed separately (competition impact, n = 13 species, no competition impact, n = 27 species; predation impact, n = 15 species, no predation impact, n = 25 species ) . Due to small sample sizes, impacts caused by other mechanisms (hybridisation, grazing, disease transmission, parasitism and structural impacts) were pooled to form a single group titled ‘Other impact mechanisms’ (impact, n = 17 species, no impact, n = 23 species ) . Costs were again analysed as a continuous response variable. We included all impacts caused by a species (not only a species' most severe impacts) when identifying the types of impacts they have. Where a species' impacts were associated with more than one impact mechanism, they were analysed for each of these mechanisms. .5 | Analysis— Identifying drivers of biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
We used the same 100 randomly selected phylogenetic trees, and phylogenetic linear regression (the phylolm function) (Tung Ho & Ané, 2014 ) . We analysed each of the 10 predictor variables against (1) severity of biodiversity impact (a two- level response variable— ‘less severe’ impacts and ‘more severe’ impacts using the phyloglm function ) , and (2) monetary cost (a continuous response variable using the phylolm function ) . The biodiversity impact analysis was similar in approach to that published by Evans, Kumschick, et al. (2018) (the results of this study are summarised in Table 1) but with a different set of alien bird species and a modified set of predictor variables. Undertaking the biodiversity impact analysis in this study, instead of using the results published in Evans, Kumschick, et al. (2018 ) , enabled direct comparisons with the monetary cost analysis undertaken in this study.
We analysed each response variable separately (univariate analysis) and then all variables together, to identify variables with the strongest influence on biodiversity impact and monetary cost (multivariate analysis ) . We checked for multi- collinearity among variables using the car package (Fox & Weisberg, 2019 ) , finding slight evidence for this (highest VIF value = 3.8; Table S4, Supporting Information ) . To address this, we removed two variables that were not found to be significant in univariate analysis (V2: Sociality and V10: Relative brain size ) . This reduced VIF values (all >3; Table S4, Supporting Information ) . During multivariate analysis, for the analysis of monetary costs (using the phylolm function ) , we used the dredge function in the MuMIn package (Bartoń, 2020) to undertake automated model simplification to identify the best- reduced model as ranked by AIC. For the analysis of biodiversity impacts (using the phyloglm function ) , we were unable to use the dredge function. So we reduced the model manually; after each run of the model, we removed the least significant variable, repeating this process to find the best model (as measured by AIC ) . This approach to model simplification follows that adopted for a related study which identified factors which influence the severity of the biodiversity impacts of alien birds (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018 ) . Data for monetary cost, native and alien range size, alien residence time, body mass, brain size, diet preference (animal matter) and diet preference (seeds and fruit) were log- transformed. Plots to show the distribution of the raw data (including log transformations) are provided at Appendix A, Supporting Information. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.1.2) (R Core Team, 2021 ) . | RESULTS
The global distribution of the most severe biodiversity impacts and monetary costs of the 40 alien bird species in our dataset is shown in Figure 1. A summary of these impacts and costs for each alien bird species is provided in Table S2, Supporting Information. .1 | Linking severe biodiversity impacts with monetary costs; linking types of biodiversity impact with monetary costs
We did not find a consistent association between severity of biodiversity impact and monetary cost, although relationships were identified for some of the 100 phylogenies analysed (Table 3 ) . Alien bird species with reported predation impacts tended to have higher monetary costs (Table 3, Figure 2 ) . No associations between other types of biodiversity impact (competition and ‘other impact mechanisms’) and monetary costs were identified (Table 3 ) . Residual plots and model output summaries are provided in Appendix A, Supporting Information. .2 | Drivers of biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
In univariate analysis, positive relationships were identified for variables associated with generalism (hypothesis H2 ) . Habitat generalist alien bird species had both more severe biodiversity impacts and higher monetary costs, while diet generalist alien bird species had more severe biodiversity impacts (and higher monetary costs for some of the phylogenies tested, though this effect was not significant on average) (Table 4 ) . These were the only variables linked to both more severe biodiversity impacts and high monetary costs. Positive relationships were also identified , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [14/11/2023 ] .

EVANS et al. for variables associated with distribution (hypotheses H4 ) . Alien bird species with larger alien ranges had higher monetary costs, and those that have been present for longer also had higher monetary costs (though not for all 100 phylogenies tested) (Table 4 ) . No relationships were identified for any variables associated with other hypotheses; resource use, dietary preference and ecological flexibility (hypotheses H1, H3 and H5, respectively) (Table 4 ) . For variables with significant relationships, the distribution of species by the severity of their biodiversity impacts and their monetary costs is shown in Figure 3.
Analysing all variables together, alien bird species with more severe biodiversity impacts tended to be diet generalists, whilst alien birds with higher monetary costs tended to have larger alien ranges ( Table 5 ) . The univariate relationship between habitat breadth and more severe biodiversity impacts was not recovered; nor were the univariate relationships between habitat and diet breadth and higher monetary costs, and alien residence time and higher monetary costs. .3 | Data deficiency
Most alien bird species in our dataset were data deficient for both biodiversity impacts and monetary costs (n = 296, 71% of all species) ( Table S1, Supporting Information ) . Some species with reported biodiversity impacts were data deficient for monetary costs (n = 81, 19% of all species ) . No species that were data deficient for biodiversity impacts had data describing their monetary costs (Table S1, Supporting Information ) . | DISCUSSION .1 | Linking severity and type of biodiversity impact with high monetary costs

EVANS et al. et al., 2010) in Taiwan, but this hybridisation appears to have no tangible costs. Our assessment does not, therefore, capture certain ‘costs’ caused by alien birds. Indeed, monetary costs only tend to be reported when biodiversity impacts are considered severe enough to warrant management. However, the biodiversity impacts of alien birds in general tend to be relatively minor and often go unmanaged ( Evans et al., 2016 ) . This may be why we did not identify a link between the severity of the biodiversity impacts caused by alien birds and high monetary costs. Indeed, the highest costs caused by alien birds tend to be associated with damage to assets of value (such as buildings and agricultural crops) rather than their biodiversity impacts (Evans et al., n.d. ) .
However, we did find predatory alien birds to be associated with monetary costs. The cost calculations for our analysis are of combined management and damage costs, and not all costs associated with predatory alien bird species arise due to the management of their predation impacts; some are the result of the damage they cause to assets of value (e.g. agriculture ) . Predatory alien birds may therefore be associated with costs in part because they tend to possess characteristics that provide them with greater opportunity to cause impacts (and not only through predation of native species ) . Indeed, the alien bird species in our dataset with reported predation impacts tend to be diet and habitat generalists (average diet and habitat breadth score = 4 and 5, respectively) when compared to species that do not have reported predation impacts (2.7 and 3.2, respectively ) ; they also tend to have larger alien ranges (average = 3,690,419 km2 vs. 165,077 km2 ) . Nevertheless, predation by alien birds can be damaging to native species (Evans, 2021; Evans et al., 2016 ) , and due to the severity of these impacts, predatory alien birds may be targeted for management and thus be associated with monetary costs. For example, species in our dataset that have been managed due to their predation impacts include the African sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus ) , common myna (Acridotheres tristis ) , house crow (Corvus splendens) and weka (Gallirallus australis ) . Indeed, invasion biology research tends to focus on alien species with severe biodiversity impacts (Pyšek et al., 2008 ) , and there may therefore be more studies to identify predation impacts in comparison to other impact mechanisms, and hence more schemes to FI G U R E 2 The total monetary costs caused by alien bird species as distributed by whether they do or do not have reported predation impacts. y- axis = the total monetary cost (logged) of an alien bird species (US$ ) .

EVANS et al. manage predation impacts. Several other species in our dataset have attracted research to assess the effect of their predation impacts; e.g. the common starling (Fisher & Wiebe, 2006) and the little owl ( Athene noctua) (Hayden, 2004 ) .
However, because some alien bird species prey on other species to survive, predation impacts are likely to occur more frequently than impacts associated with some other mechanisms, such as hybridisation and transmission of diseases, and thus there may be more management schemes (with costs) to control and eradicate them. Furthermore, predation impacts may be easier to identify than impacts caused through other mechanisms, such as competition, hybridisation and the transmission of diseases (Evans et al., 2021; FI G U R E 3 ( a) The severity of the biodiversity impacts caused by alien bird species as distributed by their: (i) habitat breadth and (ii) diet breadth.

EVANS et al.
Tompkins & Jakob- Hoff, 2011 ) , and some predatory alien birds are relatively large species (though not always, see Figure 2) that prey on smaller bird species (Evans, 2021 ) , and their size may make them easier to identify and control. Thus, due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence of predation impacts, and the relative ease of the identification of predation impacts and management of (some) predatory alien birds, they are more likely to be associated with monetary costs than other impact mechanisms. Interventions to stop the introduction of predatory alien birds may prevent frequent ( and potentially severe) biodiversity impacts and unwanted monetary costs associated with schemes to manage them. .2 | Identifying factors associated with biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
Our results suggest that certain factors afford alien birds greater opportunity to cause deleterious effects, whether they be on biodiversity or the economy, or both. Habitat and diet generalists are more likely to have impacts than specialist species restricted to a limited range of environments and food types. This may be because they have greater opportunity to cause impacts, as they are likely to interact with a broader range of native species and to come into contact with a wider range of assets of value to humans. Indeed, the species in our dataset with broad environmental tolerances also tend to be able to occupy urban environments, where they may cause biodiversity impacts in parks and gardens and affect assets of value such as buildings. All but one of the eight species with the greatest habitat breadth in our dataset (occupying six or more broad habitat types) have severe biodiversity impacts and monetary costs >$0.
Variables associated with the geographic distribution of alien species (alien residence time, and in particular, alien range size) were also predictors of monetary costs. This is likely to be because widespread species have a greater opportunity to cause deleterious effects on both biodiversity and the economy and in different ways at different locations (see Figure 1 ) . For example, the common myna has one of the largest alien ranges in our dataset ( > 2,300,000 km2; the median for all species in our dataset = 114,864 km2 ) . It has reported monetary costs on French Polynesia and Seychelles (Evans et al., n.d.) and reported competition impacts in Australia (Grarock et al., 2012) and predation impacts in Israel, and on Seychelles, Cook Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Hawaii, Mauritius and Midway Atoll (it is known to prey on at least 16 native bird species from five orders) (Evans, 2021 ) . Alien bird species present for longer time periods have had more time to establish and spread. For example, the African sacred ibis was introduced to France in the 1970s, and its population spread along the Atlantic Coast over several decades before the implementation of a costly eradication programme to address its unwanted impacts, which included predation of native birds (Yésou et al., 2017 ) .
Because generalist and widespread alien bird species have a greater opportunity to cause deleterious effects (on either biodiversity or the economy ) , they are also more likely to be subject to control or eradication measures, which can be costly. Indeed, over half of the 10 species in our dataset with the greatest habitat breadth and longest alien residence times have reported costs associated with their management. These costs are likely to increase as the distributional extent of an alien species' increases and it becomes more difficult to control or eradicate. The unsuccessful eradication of approximately 1 million house crows in Zanzibar (Tanzania ) , undertaken to address deleterious effects on both biodiversity and the economy ( ZABISO, 2020 ) , has so far cost approximately US$1.5 million (van Ham et al., 2013 ) ; the successful eradication of a small population of house crows ( < 30) on Socotra Island (Yemen) cost US$20,500 ( Suleiman & Taleb, 2010 ) .
Our results suggest that timely management interventions, sensu ( Hulme et al., 2009 ) , to limit the distributional extent of alien bird species (particularly generalist species and those that prey on native species) may have important benefits for both biodiversity and the economy. It may be too late to efficiently address the impacts of some widespread, generalist, predatory alien bird species such as the ring- necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) in the UK, as these efforts are now likely to be costly (Ahmed et al., 2022 ) . However, there may be opportunities to do so for recent alien bird incursions, and for those occurring in the future (alien species' numbers are predicted to rise considerably by 2050, including numbers of alien bird species) (Seebens et al., 2021 ) . In the UK, for example, climate change may be assisting the establishment of the red- billed leiothrix ( Leiothrix lutea) (Broughton et al., 2022 ) .
We identified a negative (though non- significant) trend between relative brain size and both severity of biodiversity impact and monetary cost. This is likely due to the presence of several parrot species in our dataset, which are large- brained and tend to have minor biodiversity impacts and low (or no) reported monetary costs. That said, two parrot species in our dataset do have high reported monetary costs (the ring- necked parakeet and the monk parakeet [Myiopsitta monachus] ) , and the ring- necked parakeet also has ‘more severe’ biodiversity impacts; e.g. by preying on native bat species in Spain (Hernández- Brito et al., 2018 ) . Notably, these are the two parrot species in our dataset with the largest alien ranges, longest alien residence times and greatest habitat breadth scores (all variables associated with severe biodiversity impacts and/or monetary costs ) . .3 | Comparing our results to past studies
Although our dataset is relatively small (40 species; approximately onethird of the 116 species identified as having environmental impacts worldwide) (Evans et al., 2016 ) , the biodiversity impacts and monetary costs in our dataset are broadly distributed across the globe. In another global study (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018 ) , factors associated with the distributional extent of alien birds (alien range size and alien residence time) were found to be predictors of more severe biodiversity impacts. Our study is the first to test the influence of these factors on the socio- economic impacts (monetary costs) of alien birds, and we , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [14/11/2023 ] .

EVANS et al. confirm that distributional extent not only drives more severe biodiversity impacts but also high monetary costs. Our results for generalism support the findings of previous studies, which have found habitat and diet breadth to be predictors of more severe biodiversity impacts at the global scale (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) and habitat breadth to be a predictor of more severe biodiversity and socio- economic impacts at the regional scale (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013; Shirley & Kark, 2009 ) . However, our study was the first to use cost data, and it demonstrates that generalism is specifically linked with higher costs (as opposed to broadly defined socio- economic impacts ) . Indeed, using data on costs, our study is the first to try to link the severity and type of biodiversity impacts caused by alien birds with their monetary costs. In so doing, our study demonstrates that predation impacts are more likely to be associated with monetary costs when compared to other mechanisms.
Two regional studies found body mass to be associated with more severe biodiversity impacts and socio- economic impacts in Europe (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013 ) , but we did not identify any significant relationships with body mass at the global scale. For biodiversity impacts, this may be because analysis undertaken in the two regional studies did not include data on island impacts (as many islands occupied by alien birds are located outside of Europe ) . Biodiversity impacts caused by alien birds tend to be particularly severe on islands (Evans, 2021; Evans et al., 2021 ) , and some of these impacts (in our dataset) are caused by relatively small alien bird species such as the red- vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer ) . With regard to monetary costs, there are several relatively small alien bird species in our dataset that have costs by causing agricultural damage in low- income regions, such as the village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus) in the Dominican Republic; there are many low- income regions outside of Europe. The contrasting results of these regional studies and our global study suggest that alien bird risk assessments should account for scale. For example, our results may not be as relevant to biodiversity risk assessments for alien bird incursions within mainland Europe, where no islands are present. .4 | Data deficiency and impact prediction
Most alien bird species in our dataset do not have reported biodiversity impacts or monetary costs. It has been concluded that alien bird species with no reported biodiversity impacts that have large alien ranges and/or long alien residence times are likely to have minor biodiversity impacts because if these impacts were severe, they would have been noticed and reported (Evans, Pigot, et al., 2018 ) . On this basis, we suggest that alien bird species with these traits that have no reported monetary costs are genuinely likely to have low monetary costs (those that can be monetised ) . However, as the impacts of alien species tend to be context dependent (Pyšek et al., 2020 ) , and human development influences the availability of impact data across different regions of the world (Evans & Blackburn, 2020 ) , we cannot rule out that some alien bird species with no reported costs do actually have monetary costs particularly in less developed regions. Indeed, the economic impacts of alien species are often felt most acutely by the rural poor, where they affect agricultural activities and food security (Perrings, 2005 ) , but alien species tend to be less studied in these regions (Bellard & Jeschke, 2015 ) .
Many species (n = 81) with reported biodiversity impacts are data deficient for monetary costs. Nevertheless, these species tend to have relatively small alien ranges when compared to alien bird species with reported monetary costs (Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . As we found alien range size to be positively correlated with monetary cost, it is possible that some of these species will have low monetary costs. Nevertheless, some of the 81 species that are data deficient for monetary costs have relatively large alien ranges, such as the house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) (see Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . As alien range size is positively correlated with cost, species like this may have monetary costs that ( as far as we are aware) have not been published.
Four predatory alien bird species (raptors) that have been introduced to oceanic islands to control rats and insect pests have severe biodiversity impacts by preying on native species, but they are data deficient for monetary costs; the Australian masked- owl (Tyto novaehollandiae ) , barn owl (Tyto alba ) , great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) and swamp harrier (Circus approximans) (Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . Their predation impacts may be difficult to value, and their opportunity to cause negative socio- economic impacts on islands may be limited, as there may be fewer assets of value to affect, and thus their costs may be low (Vaissière et al., 2022 ) . This may be why two other species with severe biodiversity impacts on islands have a cost value of US$0 (the green junglefowl (Gallus varius) and black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) (Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . This absence of cost data for raptors on islands may appear to counter our result regarding the positive association between predation and monetary costs. However, the Australian masked- owl is to be eradicated from Lord Howe Island (Australia) due to the severity of its biodiversity impacts (O'Dwyer & Carlile, 2016 ) , and barn owls are being managed in Hawaii due to their biodiversity impacts (Bean, 2013; Raine et al., 2019 ) . These management actions will be costly, but as far as we are aware, these costs have not been published. Thus, severe predation impacts on islands may also drive monetary costs. This may also appear to counter our result regarding the positive association between alien range size and monetary cost (as being on islands, these alien raptor species have small alien ranges; Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . However, costs incurred managing alien raptors on islands are likely to be relatively low compared to damage and management costs associated with broadly distributed alien bird species at mainland locations (Evans et al., n.d. ) . | CONCLUSIONS
By combining data on the biodiversity impacts, socio- economic impacts and monetary costs of alien birds, we identify links between their biodiversity impacts and monetary costs. Our results indicate that management interventions to prevent the introduction of both predatory and , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [14/11/2023 ] .

EVANS et al. generalist alien bird species, or that reduce their geographic distribution at early stages of invasions, may have significant biodiversity and economic benefits. We missed the opportunity to efficiently manage some alien bird species which are now widespread and abundant across many regions of the world; we need not miss these opportunities for future alien bird invasions, which are predicted to increase in number in the future (Seebens et al., 2021 ) . Whilst we lack data on the monetary costs associated with many alien bird species, we predict that some of these species are likely to have low monetary costs. Nevertheless, our results lead us to conclude that species with no reported costs but with large alien ranges and/or predation impacts should be further studied as potential candidates for high monetary costs.

Handling Editor: Patricia Carignano Torres Abstract . Decades of theory and scholarship on the concept of human well- being have informed a proliferation of approaches to assess well- being and support public policy aimed at sustainability and improving quality of life. . Human well- being is multidimensional, and well- being emerges when the dimensions and interrelationships interact as a system. In this paper, we illuminate two crucial components of well- being that are often excluded from policy because of their relative difficulty to measure and manage: equity and interrelationships between humans and the environment. . We use a mixed- methods approach to review and summarize progress to date in developing well- being constructs (including frameworks and methods) that address these two components. . Well- being frameworks that do not consider the environment, or interrelationships between people and their environment, are not truly measuring well- being in all its dimensions. . Use of equity lenses to assess well- being frameworks aligns with increasing efforts to more holistically characterize well- being and to guide sustainability management in ethical and equitable ways. . Based on the findings of our review, we identify several pathways forward for the development and implementation of well- being frameworks that can inform efforts to leverage well- being for public policy. | People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL. | INTRODUCTION
Well- being is at the core of public policy efforts to engender just, equitable and sustainable futures in a rapidly changing world, especially amidst the increasing frequency of climatic, environmental and economic shocks that affect human well- being. But what constitutes living well, or a good life? While answers to this question vary among individuals and social groups throughout the world, researchers and policymakers have drawn from over 50 years of theory and scholarship on well- being to develop measures that can span mental and physical health, social, cultural, spiritual, economic and environmental dimensions, among others (see Barrington- Leigh & Escande, 2018; King et al., 2014 ) . In their review of the concept and assessment of well- being in a socioecological context, King et al. (2014) describe the evolution of various ways to assess wellbeing, including the so- called ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ measures of social components, environmental sustainability indicators, quality of life indices and theories of multidimensional well- being. They, along with other efforts to summarize conceptualizations of human well- being in published literature (see Boarini et al., 2014; Hoekstra, 2019; Lijadi, 2018; Schleicher et al., 2017; White, 2015 ) , review the proliferation of well- being frameworks in recent decades and illustrate the wide range of interpretations of the concept and its dimensions.
Increasingly, well- being frameworks emphasize considerations of equity1 and relational values. One such example is the concept of Nature's Contributions to People, put forth by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES, 2019 ) , which builds on the ecosystem service concept popularized by the landmark Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005 ) , to highlight the various ways (positive and negative) that nature shapes people's well- being (Díaz et al., 2018 ) . Another example is the 4Cs framework (Breslow et al., 2016 ) , a conceptual human well- being framework designed specifically for use in ecosystem- based management by resource managers and decision- makers. The 4Cs framework describes the major constituents of human well- being as: connections (being with others and the environment ) , capabilities ( enabling individuals and communities to act meaningfully to pursue their goals ) , conditions (circumstances where human needs are met ) , and cross- cutting domains of equity and justice, security, resilience and sustainability.
Building on a long legacy of attempts to determine what constitutes a good life (Hoesktra, 2019 ) , frameworks such as these two examples represent both an expansion of how well- being is conceptualized and an opportunity to rethink efforts to advance well- being in research and public policy. These efforts face considerable challenges, including determining what to track and measure among the infinite variety of possibilities, who decides what and how to measure, and how results are used within and across different scales. We argue that amidst this complexity, a true understanding of well- being is incomplete if it overlooks well- being frameworks that consider (a) the inherently linked environmental dimension of human well- being and (b) equity. To date, there is no comprehensive review of how frameworks such as these have been developed and implemented. Below we explore these two factors, and outline how they inform the aims of this paper in providing an updated and broader review of existing well- being frameworks and methods (henceforth, termed constructs2 ) .
The environment3 is a cross- cutting factor crucial to well- being. When researchers and practitioners adopt a holistic lens that includes an environmental dimension of well- being, they can characterize linked human and environmental systems, and provide rich context about social values and priorities. This lens is essential to the development of equitable and effective policies and management actions in support of a desired social– ecological state (Armitage et al., 2012; Helne & Hirvilammi, 2015; Schleicher et al., 2017 ) . Wellbeing, after all, is not simply a collection of dimensions, but rather a combination of interrelated, dynamic factors across social, cultural, economic, political and environmental contexts. As indicated by Carmenta et al. (this issue) and Schleicher et al. (2017 ) , the centrality of the environment to human well- being has gained increased attention in recent years in the development and sustainability literatures and to some extent in the international policy arena (partially in response to the growing prevalence of large- scale natural disasters such as flooding, wildfires, droughts, etc. which negatively impact human well- being on a mass scale; UNDRR, 2020 ) , yet knowledge gaps remain in determining how environmental dimensions intersect with objective, subjective, collective and relational aspects of wellbeing (Bennett et al., 2015; Coulthard et al., this issue; McKinnon et al., 2016 ) .
As framed by Schleicher et al. (2017) in their review of philosophical accounts and conceptual frameworks of well- being, there is a distinction between constructs that consider the environment as a ‘determinant’ of human well- being (instrumental external driver ) , and those that consider the environment as a ‘constituent’ (internal) element of well- being (Dasgupta, 2001 ) . In their study, Schleicher et al. found that where frameworks mention an environment– well- being relationship, the environment is most often treated as a determinant. We argue that well- being constructs should consider the environment to be a constituent of well- being, and should also recognize the interrelationships (i.e. synergies, trade- offs and neutral interactions) between people and their environment that are crucial to well- being (Howe et al., 2014; Schleicher et al., 2017 ) .

BETLEY ET aL.
Research that explicitly addresses the dynamic reciprocal interactions and relational values between people and the environment (Chan et al., 2016, 2018; Gould et al., 2020; Leong et al., 2019; Stålhammar & Thorén, 2019) contributes to a broad shift in public policy towards more holistic accounts of human– nature connectedness and to conceptualizations of well- being rooted in diverse knowledge systems and worldviews (Díaz et al., 2015, 2018; Helne & Hirvilammi, 2015 ) . Consideration of these relationships requires addressing well- being through a systems approach— explicitly considering the structure (parts and interrelationships ) , behaviour and purpose or function of complex adaptive systems (Preiser et al., 2018; Figure 1 ) . In systems theory, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts (Meadows, 2008 ) , and relational systems thinking considers how the embedded relationships between parts of a system inform its overall function or purpose (Goodchild, 2021 ) .
It is well established that systemic and structural inequities have significant and differential impacts on well- being (Bailey et al., 2017; Guedes et al., 2012; Mitra et al., 2020 ) . To address this, some emphasize that well- being is culturally mediated and may not be equally or homogeneously experienced across social groups, such as within and across Indigenous and non- Indigenous groups, or urban and rural dwellers (Cooke et al., 2007; Cooper et al., 2014; Sangha et al., 2015; Virtanen et al., 2020 ) . These framings recognize that historical legacies privilege or empower some while marginalizing others, producing hierarchies across language, culture, socioeconomic context, value systems and geography (Aguado et al., 2018 ) . Equity is central to developing and implementing well- being constructs in terms of power and politics (Leach et al., 2018 ) . Those applying an equity lens to understanding well- being (Figure 1c) might ask: What are different ways well- being can be framed or understood and by whom? Whose worldviews, knowledge and values frame well- being metrics? Who is defining well- being constructs, and who is excluded from this process and from decision- making that relates to well- being? How are rights, responsibilities, benefits and costs distributed? What is the political, economic, environmental and social context for inequities, including historical and current power dynamics? In this paper, we assess how equity has been considered in such constructs, as we believe researchers and practitioners would benefit from learning about why and how equity is considered in past and ongoing efforts to measure well- being (McDermott et al., 2013 ) .
Given the evolving scholarship on well- being and the drive for public policy that provides it, researchers and practitioners may struggle to navigate the landscape of well- being constructs that have been developed and implemented to date, and to report on the frameworks they choose to apply (Figure 1 ) . In this paper, we report on the results of a search to identify well- being constructs, published in peer- reviewed and grey literature, that consider multiple interacting dimensions of human well- being, including an environmental dimension, as well as equity. To inform future efforts to leverage well- being for public policy, we then assess these wellbeing constructs through the following research questions: (a) How are well- being constructs that consider environmental dimensions and equity being developed, measured and applied to decisionmaking? (b) How do well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects consider environmental dimensions of well- being, and to what extent do these constructs illuminate interrelationships between human well- being and environmental dimensions? and (c) FI G U R E 1 Conceptual framework of well- being using environmental and equity lenses. (a) Human well- being is multidimensional. Indices of well- being vary in terms of which dimensions are measured, for example some measure human well- being without considering the environment in which people live or without considering cultural dimensions (the seven icons shown are hypothetical dimensions derived from Sterling et al., 2020 and randomly placed within the space shown ) ; (b) Well- being is not simply a collection of dimensions, but rather a system of interrelated dimensions. Well- being emerges when the dimensions and interrelationships interact as a system, in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts; (c) In this paper, we use two different lenses or perspectives to help illuminate crucial components of well- being; a lens centred on equity and a lens on interrelationships between humans and the environment ( a) ( b) ( c) | People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL.
How do well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects consider equity? | METHODS
We conducted a review of peer- reviewed and grey literature to explore emerging understandings of well- being constructs that consider (a) interrelationships between people and their environment and (b) equity. For this review, we adapted the systematic map approach in ‘Guidelines and Standards for Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management’ developed by the Centre for Evidence Based Conservation at Bangor University (Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, 2018 ) , including validation of interreviewer reliability during screening and data extraction. .1 | Search strategy
We designed and tested search sets consisting of search terms to identify probable well- being constructs described in relevant peerreviewed articles published in Web of Science (see Appendix A in Supporting Information for search strategy ) . We combined the search outputs with additional peer- reviewed and grey literature identified through purposive sampling and expert solicitation, including several articles from this Special Issue, and through institutional and organizational website searches. Our search strategy included backward citation searching of literature screened for inclusion in our coding, and forward citation searching of selected included literature ( Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, 2018; Livoreil et al., 2017 ) . .2 | Screening of search returns
We performed abstract and title level screening of all citations from our search strategy using Colandr (Cheng et al., 2018 ) . Studies were included for coding if they met the following three criteria: ( a) the study attempts to measure or quantify human well- being; ( b) the study considers multiple dimensions of well- being, including an environmental dimension (i.e. broadly conceived; the study can consider the environment to be a determinant or a constituent of well- being ) ; and (c) the study considers equity. To validate interreviewer reliability, reviewers assessed a sub- sample of search returns through blinded side- by- side screening to calibrate interpretation of the criteria prior to screening the full set of returns. A list of all studies coded, along with their associated well- being constructs, is included in Appendix B in Supporting Information. .3 | Data extraction
We developed an a priori codebook to extract information from each codable study and refined the codebook through an iterative process with the multidisciplinary coding team. This iterative process included multiple blinded test coding rounds, where inter- reviewer agreement and the codebook descriptions were improved through discussion of any discrepancies in extraction of both objective and subjective data. We extracted data to assess the following aspects: general information on the study (overview and context, including geography, sector, scale and well- being definition ) ; the development and measurement of a construct (including methods, dimensions, considerations of equity and of interrelationships between dimensions, and indicators ) ; and implementation of the construct for decision- making (for full codebook, see Appendix A in Supporting Information ) . Coding fields included a combination of a priori categories and free text. In some instances, multiple studies covered the same construct, each providing additional information, in which case we coded all relevant information from the studies as a single construct.
We used several equity lenses to assess how well- being constructs aspects consider equity, from how constructs are developed and implemented, to what is being measured by the constructs. One equity lens drew from Friedman et al.’s (2018) summary of the literature on social equity in the biodiversity conservation arena, noting four commonly used components across disciplines: distributional (distribution of rights, responsibilities, costs and benefits ) ; procedural (how decisions are made and by whom ) ; recognitional ( equal status for different distinct identities, histories, values and interests— related to cognitive justice ) ; and contextual (a broader grouping of underlying social, economic, environmental and political factors ) . A second lens assessed how equity is considered across a range of categories of social differentiation, from race and gender to ability and religion. .4 | Analysis
We calculated descriptive statistics on the studies in our dataset and undertook a qualitative inductive thematic review ( Thomas & Harden, 2008) of coded studies to address our research questions. To validate inter- reviewer reliability, multiple reviewers analysed qualitative data that was extracted as free text, and discussed any discrepancies in interpretation to reach agreement. | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We identified 377 potentially relevant studies through our search strategy, and after abstract and title- level screening for inclusion criteria, we included 79 studies for coding (reflecting 53 constructs— see Appendix B for list of all included constructs ) . Figure 2 is an index for the findings from our analysis of coded well- being constructs in relation to our research questions. We present our key findings from our review here, and additional results from our data extraction are in Appendix C. | 5

BETLEY ET aL. .1 | How are well- being constructs that consider environmental dimensions and equity being developed, measured and applied to decision- making? .1.1 | Defining well- being
We examined whether the studies provided a definition of well- being, and if so, how well- being was conceived, which is likely to influence how well- being is operationalized. We found that roughly one- third of the final coded dataset provided an explicit definition of wellbeing; in the other studies, the coder could infer a definition (45%) or one was not present at all (~20% ) .4 We found a range of references cited in these definitions, with three frameworks appearing more than once: the capability framework of Sen (1999 ) ; the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2020) framework; and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework ( MA, 2005 ) .
The definitions provided varied in how they framed well- being. For example, several studies specifically acknowledged that wellbeing is an ambiguous concept that can be defined and interpreted in different ways (e.g. Aguado et al., 2018; Lebel et al., 2015 ) . Some well- being definitions include both social and ecological systems ( e.g. Breslow et al., 2016; Donkersloot et al., 2020) and others frame their definition around ‘outcomes that matter to people’ (e.g. OECD, 2020 ) . The concept of subjective well- being was also commonly mentioned in the provided definitions (e.g. Tauro et al., this issue; Donkersloot et al., 2020 ) . Another common theme was the mention of the contextualized nature of well- being, as demonstrated by the multiple studies citing the capabilities approach by Sen (1999) which emphasizes the importance of context, resisting a set list of parameters required for well- being.
Given our research questions B and C, we specifically assessed whether the definitions included terms related to equity, the environment and interrelationships between dimensions to understand how fundamental these aspects were considered in regard to well- being. Our results show that over one- third of the studies integrated some equity concerns within their well- being definition, using a range of equity- adjacent terms such as equality, recognition, capability, justice and empowerment. More than half of the studies integrated environmental aspects with their well- being definition with terms such as sustainable, ecosystem services, environment and nature. Nearly 25% of the definitions mentioned interrelationships with phrasings such as ‘links between wellbeing and nature’ (Tauro et al., this issue ) , ‘relationships with place’ ( Carmenta et al., this issue) and ‘harmonious coexistence with nature’ (León, 2015 ) .
We found it notable that in a set of cases chosen partially for their focus on well- being, two- thirds did not provide an explicit definition of the term. Of the definitions provided, there was diversity in the citations referenced and aspects included, which reflects the myriad ways in which the concept can be conceived and mirrors other wellbeing research showing that the term is broadly used by a range of disciplines that apply different meanings. The use of well- being and emphasis of its associated terms (subjective, objective and relational well- being) has changed through time, often impacted by the field in which it is used (White, 2015 ) , and like terms such as ‘resilience’ FI G U R E 2 Index for findings from the three research questions in this paper. The findings from our first research question (a) span five aspects assessed through our codebook, from defining well- being to implementing constructs. The findings from our second research question (b) relate primarily to exploring well- being construct dimensions and interactions between dimensions, and are further explored in defining well- being. The findings from our third research question (c) index across both (a) and (b ) , and are organized into three overarching sections: components of equity lens, categories of social differentiation lens and implications of using equity lenses ( a) ( b) ( c) | People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL. ( Baggio et al., 2015) and the ‘anthropocene’ (Braje & Lauer, 2020 ) , is acting as a boundary object which requires continuing scrutiny. .1.2 | Exploring well- being construct dimensions and interactions between dimensions
We explored the range of dimensions, or conceptual categories, that constructs used to organize different aspects of well- being. The majority of the coded constructs had dimensions related to environmental, health, social, cultural and economic aspects; however, these were operationalized in different ways. The environmental dimension is explored in depth in section 3.2. We found that most constructs measured positive or desirable aspects of well- being. However, many also specifically discuss negative aspects (or illbeing ) . For instance, in their study of the impacts of private protected areas and ecotourism through interviews of local people, Serenari et al. (2017) identified ‘eviction with few alternatives’ due to privatization of land as a recurring theme in a local communities’ well- being framework, and Estes (2015) notes the need to balance between the use of positive and negative indicators within dimensions.
The majority of studies (65%) did not report on interactions (such as synergies and trade- offs) between any dimensions of well- being. Of those that did, we found that roughly 20% explicitly recognized interactions while in 15% of cases the recognition was inferred. Similar patterns arose in data collection for well- being constructs. While many studies discussed the importance of recognizing or considering interactions across dimensions, few actually included this in design, measurement or implementation, though Pinar (2019) propose a method to incorporate interactions between dimensions that can be tailored to a particular place.
Well- being frameworks work within the context of complex social– ecological systems and should, theoretically, encompass interactions and change dynamics. Yet, many frameworks do not yet do so. A focus on aggregate notions of well- being— for example on overall poverty, or single elements such as cash income as the primary measure of poverty— can miss heterogeneity in social and ecological dimensions of poverty as well as the dynamics within and between dimensions of well- being (Agrawal & Chhatre, 2011; Woodhouse et al., 2018 ) . This same pattern in overlooking heterogeneity and dynamics is seen in approaches to understanding ecosystem services; most studies focus on a single service at a time and do not consider the interplay between them (Renard et al., 2015) or disregard the need for disaggregate analysis of ecosystem service benefits across social groups, especially marginalized groups (Chaudhary et al., 2018 ) . Efforts to frame outcomes in terms of interrelationships reflect attempts to move beyond mono- consequentialism and recognize where change in one dimension may induce complementary change or occur at the cost of other dimensions of well- being (e.g. Fischer et al., 2017; Hirsch et al., 2013; Oracion et al., 2005 ) .
Thoroughly capturing and reflecting the relationships within and across well- being dimensions requires moving beyond the idea of winners and losers and framings of synergies or co- benefit scenarios. A social group, or even an individual, can simultaneously experience gains in some dimensions and losses in others (Cinner et al., 2014; Daw et al., 2011; O'Brien & Leichenko, 2003 ) . Thus, cobenefit framings can oversimplify the diversity and complexity of impacts from change and come with a potential high risk to reward ratio (Gurney et al., 2015 ) . Without taking into account all likely dimensions of well- being that are important for local contexts and the range of interactions between these dimensions, programmes risk exacerbating existing inequities and stressors (McShane et al., 2011) and limiting long- term sustainability (Chaigneau & Brown, 2016 ) . In addition, by not taking into account interactions between dimensions (both in concept and in practice ) , programmes could lead to false conclusions that objectives were achieved without significant costs when in reality, those costs may have been experienced but not measured. .1.3 | Developing constructs
We found varying levels of detail regarding how a construct was developed. For some constructs, there was little to no information on the process and methods by which it was created (e.g. Centre for Thriving Places, 2019; Fontalvo- Herazo et al., 2007; Office for National Statistics, 2020 ) ; we could not find information on how different categories were determined and/or who had a say in the development process. Other studies provide extensive detail around the development process itself (e.g. Meo- Sewabu, 2015; New Zealand Government, 2019; Trebeck & Abeyasekera, 2012 ) . This could be for several reasons; first, some constructs provide more detail as they are aiming to create and describe a framework for use by other researchers and practitioners. In this case, providing such detail is crucial to allow for replication of the construct. It is also possible that for some of the constructs with little to no detail, definitive documents exist on the construct that are hard to find. If so, these details should be more widely shared.
We found that almost half (45%) of the studies in our final dataset described some type of validation of the construct as it was developed. Construct validation varied in approach and included triangulation of data (Pereira et al., 2005 ) , testing against alternatives ( Wallace et al., 2020 ) , peer review (Meo- Sewabu, 2015; NZEPA, ) and literature review (Centre for Thriving Places, 2019; City of Santa Monica, 2017 ) . Validation also involved surveys and/or interviews to determine whether the construct appropriately reflects what is important to those whose well- being is being measured, an indication of procedural equity in construct development; see more discussion on this in Section 3.3 (Camfield & Ruta, 2007; Canadian Index of Wellbeing, 2016; Meo- Sewabu, 2015 ) . Some studies discussed a single validation event, whereas others employed a dynamic approach with regular ground truthing of the construct (Canadian Index of Wellbeing, 2016 ) .
We found that two- thirds of the well- being constructs we coded included indicators, and of that subset, we identified two broad conceptual approaches to how a construct was developed. | 7
People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL.
One process conceptually begins at the indicator level, building upon pre- existing indicators to develop a well- being construct ( hereafter ‘indicators to concept’ ) . Almost 40% of constructs that provided indicators were categorized by this model, in which the index is a direct reflection of the underlying available metrics. We found the majority of constructs using this approach were applied at national or broader regional scales. The other approach conceptually moves in the opposite direction (hereafter ‘concept to indicators’ ) : the well- being construct is first developed, which, in turn, determines the underlying indicators; these constructs are primarily applied at sub- national and local levels. We found both approaches among the well- being constructs we coded. For instance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Well- being Index (Summers et al., 2017 ) , Thriving Places Index (Centre for Thriving Places, 2019) and Canadian Index of Wellbeing (Canadian Index of Wellbeing, 2016) take an ‘indicators to concept’ approach. In contrast, the Vanuatu National Sustainable Development Plan Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (DSPPAC, 2017 ) , Indicators of Resilience in Socioecological Production Landscapes and Seascapes (Dunbar et al., 2020 ) , and New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority Matauranga [Māori] Framework (NZEPA, 2020) take a ‘concept to indicators’ approach. Some constructs (e.g. the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability or UNU- IAS framework) were developed to be applicable across social groups by suggesting more general indicators that can be tailored to suit local contexts and needs ( Verschuuren et al., 2014 ) .
When considering the two methodological approaches to indicator development (‘indicator to concept’ vs. ‘concept to indicator’ ) , we see trade- offs. Constructs that are developed from existing indicators might be more quickly and easily implemented, and more easily compared across diverse contexts as the underlying indicator data are already being measured and collected. One consideration, however, is whether these a priori indicators are measuring what is most important for well- being, or rather selecting data that are readily available. For instance, the Thriving Places Index is described as, ‘first and foremost… a resource that can be used’ because it pulls from ‘data that is already available, rather than creating a wishlist of ideal indicators’ (Centre for Thriving Places, 2019, p. 14 ) . This practical aspect of being readily usable certainly has its merits; however, exclusively using source data from global datasets and/or national statistical offices might reflect certain notions of what should be measured (or can easily be measured at scale) rather than the most meaningful measures (Sterling, Filardi, et al., 2017 ) . That said, existing indicators can certainly have meaning for the people it is measuring. For instance, the Canadian Well- being Index uses pre- existing indicators from different Canadian authorities, but is the result of extensive consultation with groups of Canadians to ensure it reflects what matters most to them and reflects the importance of procedural equity in developing constructs (see more discussion on this in Section 3.3 ) .
The approach that takes ‘concept to indicator’ might better reflect the group for which it is describing well- being. This approach requires rigor in understanding what really matters to that group and then determining how to measure sometimes intangible attributes (similar to the process described in Section 3.3 for a biocultural approach that centres equity ) . However, in our experience, and inferred from the reviewed cases, a concept to indicators approach can be very rewarding in its relevance but also take extensive time and resources to measure, collect, store and analyse the resulting data. Such an approach can also present difficulties in developing and validating appropriate indicators and providing a robust system for continued measurement and data collection. .1.4 | Measuring constructs
We assessed how well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects collected data to measure well- being, and report here our findings on levels of measurement (see Appendix C for additional results ) .
Well- being constructs can measure well- being at different levels, such as at the individual level or a broader level such as community or collective well- being. Well- being measured at the individual or household level can be summed or averaged to give a measure of well- being for a broader group. For example, the Living Standards Measurement Survey measures progress towards poverty alleviation primarily at the household scale and uses these results to describe overall poverty across a region/area (Thomsen et al., 2018 ) . As another example, the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI; Camfield & Ruta, 2007) asks individuals to list issues that are most important to them and to score their satisfaction in those areas. This creates a personalized approach to well- being, which is aggregated across groups to provide an overall picture of well- being; similar approaches have been applied to measure poverty and livelihoods (e.g. the Basic Necessities Survey; Clements et al., 2014 ) . Approaches such as the GPGI contrast with the more common method of using predetermined metrics that are believed to be indicative of well- being for all individuals. Aggregating individual measures of well- being, regardless of how they are collected, can be useful for identifying opportunities to improve individual experience and well- being. That said, simple averages can obscure and perpetuate existing inequalities by not acknowledging underlying differences in well- being within a given population (Chaudhary et al., 2018 ) .
A second suite of framings takes into account the relationships between individual and collective well- being. Constructs with this framing acknowledge that individual well- being is intertwined with the wellbeing of the collective, underlining the relational dimension of well- being ( Donkersloot et al., 2020; Meo- Sewabu, 2015 ) . Proponents of these concepts argue that averaging or summing is not feasible because wellbeing is non- cumulative (Dawson & Martin, 2015; Irvine et al., 2016 ) . In this framing, well- being may be measured instead by the overall health of the collective, based, for instance, on social exchange networks (e.g. regularity of sharing resources with neighbours, helping in communal or neighbouring gardens, participating in roles dictated by social norms, | People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL. and contributions for future generations, etc.; Meo- Sewabu, 2015 ) . As an example, the UNU- IAS community well- being assessment framework was developed to measure well- being of rural communities, rather than individual community members, as ‘individual satisfaction is usually subsumed by broader community goals and preferences for well- being’ ( Verschuuren et al., 2014, p. 35 ) . Constructs with this framing often acknowledge that individual well- being improves through individual contributions to the collective (Donkersloot et al., 2020; Meo- Sewabu, 2015 ) . Higher- level organization and resilience can also contribute to individual well- being, for instance, through institutional capacity to respond to changes and shocks, such as with government safety nets (Ulrichs et al., 2019 ) . This includes structural aspects that are not measured at the individual scale but are integral to individual well- being (e.g. healthcare system capacity; GIPMO, 2019; Shiell et al., 2020 ) .
Some constructs acknowledge the difference between these levels and choose to measure at multiple levels. For example, the City of Santa Monica (2017) construct includes individual- level information such as health and personal outlook as well as community- level assessment that reflects aspects such as infrastructure and services.
At the broader level, the importance of collective well- being echoes what has been discussed in other sectors (e.g. conservation, natural resource management, collective and cooperative action ) , where individual contribution to and participation in management and governance of a commons resource is a crucial component of well- being at multiple scales (e.g. McCrea et al., 2014; McGregor, 2007; Ostrom, 1990; Woodhouse et al., 2015 ) . For instance, Meo- Sewabu (2015) notes that in the Fijian context, definitions of wealth and well- being (sautu) rely on relationships to other people and to the fertility of land and sea. Yalomatua, or wisdom, in the context of sautu is knowing the ‘way of being’ in relation to Vanua, which is a complex Fijian word for a people and their place/ environment, spirituality, chief, history and culture. An inability to contribute to the collective level, or to fulfil the roles set out by social norms is seen as not healthy, to the point of being disrespectful or shameful. Importantly, this framing also considers how collective strength, for instance in strong institutions such as governance or health care, can contribute to individual well- being. The Fijian worldview also resonates with the Māori concepts of whakapapa ( broadly interpreted as genealogy) and tuakana- teina (broadly interpreted as the relationship between older and younger siblings) which connects an individual to their human and non- human ancestors in addition to codifying their responsibilities to both people and place (Lyver et al., 2019 ) . These themes of collective well- being emerging in Fiji and Aotearoa New Zealand are also reflected in the Pacific Northwest, for example through efforts led by Donatuto et al. (2014 ) , Donatuto et al. (2016) to develop a community health evaluation methodology centred on Indigenous definitions of health that result from interweaving of practices and knowledge about coexistence with other humans and with nature. The Indigenous health indicators developed through this work are all measured at the community level, including dimensions of community connection, security of natural resources, cultural use, education, self- determination and resilience.
Many development policies manifest at the community level, making community well- being a crucial consideration for management. This consideration should include the relational level of interactions with others, humans or non- humans, that a particular culture or social group might view as most important for understanding their well- being. For instance, western framings are often more focused on individual well- being and place less emphasis on the importance of the health and condition of the collective as its own standalone entity or of hybrid nature– culture communities (Aumeeruddy- Thomas & Hmimsa, 2018 ) . There is a need to incorporate recognitional equity through understanding local worldviews on this notion and not privilege western, individual- focused understandings of well- being (more discussion on this in section 3.3 ) . It is clear that myriad socioeconomic and environmental factors influence well- being, and these different factors operate at different scales (Small et al., 2017 ) . As such, multilevel approaches could encompass dynamic aspects of well- being. .1.5 | Implementing constructs
Three- quarters of the constructs analysed did not mention how they were integrated into planning, monitoring and/or decision- making. However, for several constructs, there were details around how they were used in framing strategic plans, policies and programmatic decisions (e.g. Breslow et al., 2016; City of Santa Monica, 2017; DSPPAC, 2017; Dunbar et al., 2020; NZ EPA, 2020; New Zealand Government, 2019 ) . Some constructs were developed by practitioners or government agencies responsible for decision- making, for instance, the Aotearoa New Zealand EPA uses the Matauranga [Māori] Framework for decision- making in permitting review processes and also to inform a series of cultural capability building initiatives within the agency (NZ EPA, 2020 ) . Other constructs were developed by a range of stakeholders with the goal of characterizing well- being in policy- relevant ways. For example, after its development, the Canadian Index of Wellbeing convened a group of experts to review the Index's findings and develop relevant strategies and specific policy actions ( Canadian Index of Wellbeing, 2016 ) . Some studies that described implementation of a well- being construct used evaluation to identify ways that implementation could inform future applications. For example, the Aotearoa New Zealand Well- being Budget design process integrates ‘impact analysis and evaluation of policies’ to support evidence- based management (New Zealand Government, 2019, p. 6 ) . .2 | How do well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects consider environmental dimensions of well- being, and to what extent do these constructs illuminate interrelationships between human well- being and environmental dimensions?
Given our inclusion criteria, all the constructs we assessed included the environment in some way, either as a determinant or a constituent | 9
People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL. of well- being and there was variation in how the environment was described. In terms of dimensions, some constructs simply had an ‘environment’ dimension, whereas others described this dimension with terms related to the physical environment and security. Some constructs explicitly referred to the benefits to humans from the environment through the term ecosystem services. Others referred to diversity, ecosystem protection, resilience and biodiversity, or referenced humans' care for the environment through stewardship. A few environment- related dimensions referred to nature providing sustenance, with terms like ‘food’ and ‘agricultural biodiversity’. Some constructs used multiple dimensions to express the myriad ways the environment is related to well- being. For instance, Wallace et al. (2020) describe ‘adequate resources’, ‘aesthetically pleasing environment’ and ‘benign physical environment’ as three environmentally related end- state values.
As expected, the way the environmental term was characterized impacted what that dimension measured. For instance, those dimensions described in terms of security and physical properties measure whether basic properties are within ranges favourable to well- being ( e.g. temperature, lead concentration ) . Similarly, the dimensions framed in terms of their benefits to humans focus on essential resources such as clean air, water, availability of food. In contrast, dimensions that highlight the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity included different indicators such as the density of endangered species in an area (Shaker, 2018 ) .
The consideration of interrelationships between human wellbeing and environmental aspects in the constructs manifested in different ways. Some of the analysed constructs provided great detail regarding conceptualization of these connections. For instance, the IPBES Conceptual Framework of well- being describes six interlinked elements between natural and social systems, such as anthropogenic assets, which refer to built infrastructure that inherently is co- produced and linked with nature (Díaz et al., 2015 ) . IPBES’s framework acknowledges that different worldviews colour these human– nature relationships and creates space for them to change through time and vary across scales (i.e. local relationships to the environment are different from global scale feedbacks and relationships ) . Taking a different approach, Thiry et al. (2018) lay out the three key ways poverty and the environment relate to each other in their conceptualization, specifically through ‘livelihood, environmental health and vulnerability to environmental hazards’. In the case of a construct by Flaherty et al. (2019 ) , a ‘place- based lens’ was applied to fully consider the various ways that the environment impacts individuals and social groups.
Operationalizing inclusion of human– environment interrelationships was sometimes addressed through a dimension focused on one's relationship to place. For instance, the Thriving Places Index ( Centre for Thriving Places Index, 2019) includes a dimension called ‘Place and Environment’ while another construct includes a dimension called ‘Place and Planet’, that considers how the environment ( built and natural) supports community values and well- being (City of Santa Monica, 2017 ) . Other constructs include dimensions such as ‘Connection to Nature’ (Flaherty et al., 2019) and ‘Tangible and Intangible interrelationships we have with other people and with nature’ (Breslow et al., 2016 ) . Several constructs designed for planning and management of natural resources are explicit about the need to measure trade- offs and synergies related to well- being for effective policy (e.g. Llopis et al., this issue; New Zealand Government, 2019; Wallace et al., 2020 ) . Similarly, the Bhutan National Happiness Index ( Centre for Bhutan Studies & GNH Research, 2016, p. 243) describes how understanding such interlinkages ‘supports high impact policy sequencing’. Another construct explicitly calls for examination of interrelationships by applying a systems approach to indicator selection to ensure the different elements of a system and their interactions with the environment are fully considered (Fontalvo- Herazo et al., 2007 ) . The construct details that an indicator should not only measure performance regarding the system at hand, but also the other systems connected to it.
Some constructs reported on how data collection led to identification of links between people and their environment. For instance, Llopis et al. (this issue) described how the complex nature of the interrelationships at hand became apparent through interviews about well- being in Madagascar, and Dawson et al. (this issue) detail that all respondents described their well- being as inextricably linked to their Caatinga landscape in northeastern Brazil. As part of data collection, Tauro et al. (this issue) assessed the links between well- being and one's territory through land analysis (i.e. areas of forests, bodies of water, etc. ) . .3 | How do well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects consider equity? .3.1 | Components of equity lens
We found that about half of the studies clearly demonstrated procedural equity in the process of developing well- being constructs, for example, with inclusion of stakeholders and/or using a co- creation process, while a quarter of the studies demonstrated it during data collection and measurement. Several data sampling designs aimed to incorporate procedural equity, with studies describing the use of inclusive participatory techniques, empowerment, participation in governance or in construct development, and interweaving of Indigenous knowledge. For example, Biedenweg et al. (2017) explicitly considered social justice during the process of ranking and finalizing human well- being indicators for a project in Puget Sound, Washington. The project placed substantial effort in recruiting participants representing a wide range of backgrounds and expertise ( including Native Americans, conservationists, agricultural interests, economic developers and members of the conservative political Tea Party movement in the United States, among others) and followed key aspects of pluralistic social justice: the recognition and participation of diverse stakeholders and the commitment to protecting those who are most vulnerable to environmental challenges and most likely to be affected by decisions to address them. Similarly, Pereira et al. (2005) used diversity sampling techniques to account | People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL. for gender and age bias in their sampling design, in addition to seeking people engaged in different activities and people considered worse or better off economically. Fontalvo- Herazo et al. (2007) employed an inclusive participatory process to involve local coastal stakeholders in the design of a coastal management indicator system in Brazil. They encouraged participation of people from different groups and living conditions through sub- group meetings at the village level, to alleviate concerns of young, female or otherwise marginalized stakeholder groups in sharing potentially sensitive information.
In assessing how the well- being constructs in this study considered equity overall, we found variation in the consideration of the components of equity we assessed (Figure 3 ) . Distributional equity was most frequently present across development of constructs, measurement using the construct, and the few instances where a construct was implemented. We found that some studies took a very clear and purposeful approach to considering equity in their constructs, while others took a more superficial approach. As mentioned previously, the 4Cs framework developed by Breslow et al. (2016) conceives of equity and justice as a cross- cutting domain (defined as ‘comparisons among gender, age, ethnicity, income and other variables; evidence of racism and discrimination; rights; human rights violations’ ) , and represents a well- being construct that considers all four components of equity covered in our analysis. For example, distributional equity is considered in the construct's ‘Conditions’ domain, with attributes such as access to food, water and healthcare, and in the ‘Capabilities’ domain, with consideration of sovereignty and rights. Breslow et al. intentionally measure freedom and voice, engendering procedural equity and noting that public participation can sometimes be undemocratic and/or inequitable. Under the Capabilities domain, the authors provide examples of recognitional equity as factors directly enabling individuals and communities to act meaningfully to pursue their goals, including livelihoods and activities, knowledge systems, political participation and governance. Underpinning the 4C's framework is contextual equity, embodied in the definition of the equity and justice cross- cutting domain. .3.2 | Categories of social differentiation lens
The categories of social differentiation around which equity was considered varied, with gender, ethnicity, culture and class/economic most often explicitly or implicitly considered (Table 1 ) . Out of all the instances where social differentiation was considered, % were explicit and 20% implicit.5 In the development of their well- being construct, Breslow et al. (2016) explicitly considered the following equity categories: racial, gender, class/economic, ethnicity/cultural, political, social and livelihood/employment. The authors noted that equity and justice are central concerns in studies of human well- being, and that while relative experiences and perceptions of inequity negatively influence well- being and can lead to inter- group conflicts, having confidence in the security of favourable conditions, such as employment or democratic governance, contributes directly to one's well- being. Donkersloot et al. (2020) assess the sustainability and equity of Alaska salmon fisheries and examines equity across health, class/economic, ethnicity, culture, political, social and livelihood/employment categories. The authors assessed a range of indicators, including many equity- based indicators such as market value of fishery access rights compared to median household income by community, and discussed their utility and limitations as assessment tools that can effectively measure and evaluate social considerations within fishery systems. .3.3 | Implications of using equity lenses
From a procedural equity lens, cultural protocols and norms are especially important to consider when deciding on data collection methods. Our study identified some lesser known methods that carefully followed cultural customs and norms (see Appendix C ) , which, in turn, could provide insights beyond those found in more standardized approaches. Participatory methods such as transect walks and trend lines are particularly useful for taking into account the FI G U R E 3 Components of distributional, recognitional and procedural equity present in well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects (data on contextual equity are not presented, given variation in reporting of consideration of contextual equity in constructs) | 11
People and Nature
BETLEY ET aL. specificities of a particular place as an element of well- being which is context dependent. Method combinations and sequencing is also something to consider in data collection. For instance, FontalvoHerazo (2007) discussed how surveys were helpful in preliminary data collection, but were limited in that they only provided insights based on the researchers’ frame of mind at the time of designing the survey, and did not create space for additional conversation. For this reason, the authors felt it was imperative to also have participatory methods such as village meetings to help determine which indicators were most appropriate in a particular setting. Furthermore, Lebel et al. (2015) found that a combination of qualitative, quantitative and participatory methods was necessary to fully capture the most important dimensions of well- being.
Externally derived (sometimes referred to as ‘western’, ‘Eurocentric’, ‘Global North’ or ‘mainstream’) framings of well- being can be problematic if they do not resonate with local or cultural contexts, including the heterogeneity of worldviews, values and priorities circulating within them. Discordances can result in the potential misapplication of measures when social groups do not subscribe to the values prioritized via externally derived frameworks and approaches (Aguado et al., 2018; Donkersloot et al., 2020 ) . For example, analyses examining the gaps and overlaps between important components of well- being in the Pacific Islands and those described via the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) revealed that regionally important factors such as the connections between and across people and place, and the importance of Indigenous and local knowledge were represented minimally (if at all) in the globally oriented SDG framework (Sterling et al., 2020 ) . Several cases noted that single indicators rarely translate across scale and that even within a place there can be problems arriving at a consensus on what is important to measure (Breslow et al., 2016; Donkersloot, 2020 ) . This critique also resonates with calls for plural valuation processes, epistemic diversity, and with cognitive justice, or equity for all forms of knowledge that is cognizant of power disparities (Jacobs et al., 2020; Pascual et al., 2017; Rodriguez, 2017 ) . For example, Rincón- Ruiz et al. (2019) describe how the dominant ecosystem services paradigm can be reframed to be more inclusive and allow for inclusion of multiple perspectives and plural valuation.
Better understanding of local and cultural contexts for wellbeing initiatives requires an approach that explicitly identifies and learns from local values, knowledge systems and management practices, used in combination with methods to incorporate evidence from multiple sources and scales (Donatuto et al., 2016; Sterling, Betley, et al., 2017; Tengö et al., 2014 ) . This is sometimes referred to as a biocultural approach (Gavin et al., 2015 ) . Several studies have described what such an approach can look like when modification and implementation of environmental, sustainability or conservation goals are carried out with the explicit approval of, and in collaboration with, affected communities, so that the approach addresses the distinct features of those social groups (Dacks et al., 2019; McCarter et al., 2018; Sterling, Filardi, et al., 2017 ) ; this aligns with the concept to indicators approach discussed earlier in Section 3.1. Notably, biocultural approaches begin with cognitive justice and an understanding of priorities and needs defined and sanctioned through legitimate community institutions that inform community decisionmaking towards sustainable pathways for development. However, perhaps more importantly, biocultural approaches help to characterize interrelationships between biological and cultural dimensions of a system and, when used in combination with inclusive and participatory methods that engage local stakeholders, can support community empowerment and, ultimately, improved environmental and social outcomes of resource management initiatives. These types of community- focused approaches are increasingly being used for setting indicators and expressions of well- being in practical and meaningful ways for understanding and measuring well- being and progress towards sustainability. While such approaches are not without their challenges, case studies have demonstrated that when careful and explicit acknowledgement is given to inclusion of different worldviews, it can lead to a truly participatory process seen as legitimate by all involved parties (e.g. Matuk et al., 2020 ) .
Achieving equity in any effort to develop, measure and implement a well- being construct can be a multifaceted endeavour ( as reviewed by Sterling, Betley, et al., 2017 ) , given the numerous factors to consider when engaging stakeholders, such as type of engagement (e.g. passive information sharing vs. active partnership ) ; timing (e.g. initial inclusion and duration of stakeholder involvement ) ; level of transparency of the process; conflict resolution success; and other factors which must be balanced against the risk of ‘engagement fatigue’. Meo- Sewabu (2015) interrogated the complexity of procedural equity intersecting with contextual and recognitional equity by exploring cultural constructs of health and well- being in a Fijian village in Lau and in a transnational Fijian community in Whanganui, Aotearoa New Zealand. The author found that developments initially thought to create more freedom and distributional equity for the villages in fact made them more dependent on outside resources, for example market economies. As the cash economy displaces the traditional barter system and exchange of goods through kinship ties, the author argues that this TA B LE 1 Equity or equity- adjacent concepts recognized in dimensions of development (constructs, n = 41) and measurement ( constructs n = 28) of well- being constructs with environmental and equity aspects and measurement, by category of social differentiation (from most commonly recognized to least)

BETLEY ET aL. process disrupts the structures that sustain social capital within the village communities, further illuminating patterns of uneven ( Harvey, 2005; Smith, 2010) or even anti- equitable development ( Li, 2014) familiar in other disciplinary literatures. Procedural and recognitional equity is strongly emphasized throughout the construct development and data collection phases through efforts to embody ‘Fijian information- sharing protocols’ in methodology, with researchers developing an understanding of the Fijian worldview of health and well- being and using culturally appropriate procedures and working to establish good interpersonal relationships and rapport with ethnic Fijian participants. Given that value differences across scales and geographies can result in disjunctions between those collecting data and those affected by the collected data, Meo- Sewabu (2015) provides a poignant narrative on challenges the author faced with New Zealand university ethics panels proscribing methods counter to cultural procedures in her community in Fiji. The author noted that if she had followed the iterated procedures from her university (e.g. conducting interviews only with participants unknown to the researcher or in accordance with randomized sampling designed to reduce ‘bias’ ) , she risked offending her clan. Fijian protocol directs her to undertake the research in either her parents’ community or that of her husband. .4 | Limitations of this review
While we aimed to identify well- being constructs that consider both equity and environmental dimensions, this paper is not a comprehensive review of every construct that meets this criteria, in part because the study of well- being is a disparate, diverse and ever- evolving field. A search strategy that returns all of the ways well- being is conceived around the world would be an enormous effort, and new terms are emerging concomitantly in the literature. That said, future research could expand on this work by including additional search terms and conducting searches in other languages.
In bringing equity into view when assessing well- being constructs, coders in our study often needed to make inferences to identify the equity and equity- adjacent terms in studies that were not explicit about addressing equity in their constructs. We also encountered conceptual and methodological issues around power. We observe that, in our work, as well as in many of the works in the literature that we reviewed, power is acknowledged but rarely specified, much less addressed in a systematic or theoretically informed manner. As has been well established, science has never been ‘pure’ but, rather, is imperfect as the product of human influence, shaped by society and culture through time and space (Shapin, 2010 ) , caught up in the political struggles of all of their diverse contexts. We argue that what some call contextual equity or recognitional equity is crucial in the context of designing and implementing well- being metrics because what gets measured can overlook important values of people whose social group is being measured in ways that support or do not support the political goals, aspirations or movements of particular social groups engaged in the real politics of representation, authority or agency. For instance, much published scholarship is grounded in an understanding of well- being as foundationally about individual experience and that summing over a set of individual experiences via aggregation is sufficient to understand community/national well- being. However, such approaches may ignore worldviews that consider collective well- being as something with its own distinct characteristics and desired features which are not easily captured by measuring at the individual level. The result may be an insidious paradox in which the imposition of outside worldviews of well- being on the people whose well- being is being measured reproduces and reinforces existing manipulative, repressive or otherwise hegemonic structures which have been brought to bear on Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities globally, over centuries, by various colonial, missionizing, globalizing or transnational capital projects. As the political geographer, Sultana (2021, p. 7) notes in a recent analysis of such complex problems of knowledge and power, ‘Capacious, fluid, creative, and subversive thinking is necessary not only in further critiquing complexities of empire, imperialism, and capitalism but also decentring them and fostering cognitive and epistemic justice’. While our current work could not fully take up Sultana's challenge, in addition to urging that wellbeing researchers and practitioners centre equity and equityrelated topics, we strongly encourage that they enter into their projects, in advance of field research, analysis or implementation, with clarity around conceptualizations, models and methods for investigating the diverse dynamics of power. Sensitive engagement with these dynamics, always found at the intersection of society and environment, is necessary for advancing ethical science towards sustainable ecological futures and well- being across scales. We suggest that any discussion or investigation of equity and frameworks of well- being consider power dynamics, power relations, cognizance of power- disparities, and the practical ethics of empowerment for social groups located within particular political histories and sociocultural contexts. | CONCLUSION
In this review, we use a mixed- methods approach to review and summarize progress to date in developing, measuring, and implementing well- being constructs that address equity as well as interrelationships between humans and the environment.
Through our analysis of available published information on these constructs, we distil several key findings. Most importantly, we note a consistent lack of transparency and specificity in how well- being is defined in many well- being- focused studies. We find that the most frequently used dimensions in the well- being constructs in our study relate to environmental, health, social, cultural and economic aspects; and rarely do constructs consider interactions among any dimensions of well- being or potentially significant differences in local and cultural understandings of those | 13

BETLEY ET aL. dimensions themselves (Caillon et al., 2017; Sterling et al., 2020 ) . For the constructs that considered interrelationships between human well- being and environmental aspects, we found a variety of different approaches, including several constructs that address these interrelationships through a dimension focused on one's relationship to place. When reviewing how well- being constructs are developed, we identify two broad conceptual approaches, from ‘indicators to concept’ or ‘concept to indicators’ that tend to be applied most frequently at national scales and above or in local applications, respectively. We identify different ways that collective well- being can be measured: aggregated from measurements at an individual level and a level that considers interactions between individuals and the collective. The latter level can overcome methodological challenges with aggregated individual measures, because well- being is heterogeneous and non- cumulative, and also reflect cultural contexts that emphasize collective well- being. A significant majority of the studies we analysed had no mention of how the construct described was integrated into planning, monitoring and/ or decision- making.
We used two different equity lenses to assess how well- being was considered in constructs, and found that distributional equity was most frequently present across development, measurement and (infrequent) implementation of a construct. We found that some studies took a very clear and purposeful approach to considering equity in their constructs, both for components of equity and categories of social differentiation, while others took a more superficial approach. Our use of these equity lenses raised more questions than presented answers. Some of these questions include: how should well- being metrics be framed, and who defines (and who does not define) resources and allocation for measurement? Can taking an approach that considers interrelationships across human and environmental dimensions provide additional context for clarifying what rights, responsibilities, benefits and costs are, who measures and secures them, and how they are distributed? Overall, while some may express concerns about moving away from standardized quantitative metrics, others are moving forward in developing inspirational examples of well- being constructs that use intentional cultural competency and deep ethnographies to inform planning and design ( Agyeman, 2012, 2013; Rishbeth et al., 2018 ) .
Our work points to several pathways forward for development and implementation of well- being frameworks that can inform efforts to leverage well- being for public policy, especially in relation to sustainability. . Many aspects of well- being remain poorly understood, likely in part because it is such a complex and multi- scalar concept. The path forward must include sharing different ways that wellbeing is defined and sharing knowledge and expertise about development, measurement and implementation of well- beingfocused approaches. . It is not sufficient for well- being frameworks to only assess the discrete dimensions of a construct; rather frameworks must leverage interdisciplinary approaches to assess interactions among the dimensions of well- being, both in concept and in practice, that may produce trade- offs as well as synergies. . Well- being frameworks that do not consider the environment (as constituent or determinant ) , or interrelationships between people and their environment, are not truly measuring well- being in all its dimensions. Carefully designed quantitative (exploring causation) and qualitative approaches should be used to better understand the complexity of these interrelationships (see Schleicher et al., 2017 ) . . Future work should explore the implications of different ways to measure collective well- being (from aggregation of individualized measurements to broader measures of community or collective well- being) for different components of equity, in particular recognitional equity. Such work may begin to more adequately address the heterogeneous character of well- being across socially salient groups or domains within the community of study. . There is value in expanded efforts to (a) validate well- being constructs, in part to help ensure equity; (b) share how validated constructs have been integrated into planning, monitoring and/or decision- making; and (c) assess the implementation of well- being constructs for improved monitoring, evaluation and learning. . Use of equity lenses to assess well- being frameworks and further exploration of how well- being- focused approaches can advance equity in all its dimensions (distributional, procedural, contextual, and recognitional) and will support public policy aimed towards enhancing well- being amidst increasing frequency of global shocks that affect human well- being. This, in turn, aligns with increasing efforts to more holistically characterize well- being to both inform and guide sustainability management in ethical and equitable ways. . Constructs should be developed to explicitly centre equity and equity- related categories of social differentiation such as gender when it is present in their efforts (rather than implying it ) , and share information on guidelines or metrics relating to equity when the construct is being implemented while accounting for the multidimensionality and intersectional complexity of equity within particular social and cultural contexts (Leach et al., 2018 ) . In addition, if equity is not included in development, measurement or implementation of a construct, then the limitations of the construct as a result of the omission must be considered.

Sterling https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2692-8264 ENDNOTES Equity as ‘the absence of systematic disparities … between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage— that is, wealth, power, or prestige’ (Braveman & Gruskin 2003, p. 254 ) . We define a well- being construct as a framework, method, approach or tools for conceptualizing and measuring well- being. This can include conceptual frameworks, indices, dashboards and indicators. We define environment as the multidimensional concept of the nonhuman physical environment, including living and non- living components, along with the physical processes that comprise the global earth system at different scales. The environment includes humanmodified and non- human- modified systems. Example of explicit definition: ‘we define human wellbeing as a state of being with others and the environment, which arises when human needs are met, when individuals and communities can act meaningfully to pursue their goals, and when individuals and communities enjoy a satisfactory quality of life’ (Breslow et al., 2016, p. 251 ) . In contrast, Dawson and Martin (2015, p. 62) provide an example of an inferred definition; they did not state their definition but explain that they used ‘emerging frameworks for studying multiple dimensions of human wellbeing, drawing on Amartya Sen's capabilities approach to human development’. As an example of an explicit consideration of distributional equity related to health, the National Sustainable Development Plan for the Republic of Vanuatu lays out the following policy objective: to ‘Ensure that the population of Vanuatu has equitable access to affordable, quality health care through the fair distribution of facilities that are suitably resourced and equipped’ (DSPPAC, 2017, p. 11 ) . As an example of inferred consideration of class/economic, health and livelihood/employment in relation to equity, the Oxfam Humankind Index discusses ‘deprived communities’, relying on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020 which defines deprivation in terms of income, employment and health (Trebeck & Abeyasekera, 2012; Dunlop & Swales, 2012 ) .

Abstract . Selection of shade tree species for agroforestry systems must take the complexity of these systems into account. Tree species selection should maximize the provision of ecosystem services while minimizing disservices. Selected species must be adapted to local agroecological conditions and cater to farmers' needs, while considering their preferences and constraints. . The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology was developed to support said selection process using farmers' local ecological knowledge. It provides the steps to rapidly identify tree species and evaluate their impacts on a range of locally important ecosystem services. Results are uploaded to a decision support tool to tailor tree species recommendations to individual farmers' needs (www.shade treea dvice.org ) . During the 5 year timeframe between 2016 and 2020, eight studies following this methodology were conducted in various coffee and cocoa growing regions across Africa, Asia and Central America. . This article looks back at these studies to synthesize their findings and evaluate the methodology. We identified similarities in the use of tree species across different study areas, notably regarding leguminous and fruit tree species. We showed that the method was efficient to evaluate tree species' impacts on soil and climate regulation, crop production, and economic benefits. It was less efficient for evaluating impacts related to incidence of pests and diseases, often associated with knowledge gaps. The method also successfully allowed investigating the links between LEK and socio- economic groups or environmental factors. . Furthermore, we suggest a series of improvements in the methodology for future studies. These improvements include (i) broadening the scope of studies beyond tree species provision of ecosystem services to include tree species impact on farming practices; (ii) allowing the comparison of tree performances in , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

RIGAL et al. | INTRODUCTION
Multiple government, private sector and NGO driven initiatives promoting agroforestry practices in coffee and cocoa farming systems are emerging in tropical countries. These initiatives rely on a growing body of technical and science- based evidence showing that shade trees in farming systems can provide multiple benefits and contribute to sustainable agricultural models. These benefits may include enhanced income diversification and economic resilience ( Jassogne et al., 2012; Jezeer et al., 2018 ) , improved soil protection and nutrient cycling (Nijmeijer et al., 2019; Tully & Lawrence, 2012 ) , and higher carbon sequestration and resilience to climate change ( Guillemot et al., 2018; Nijmeijer et al., 2019 ) . These benefits and the overall success of agroforestry systems are however contingent upon the selection of suitable shade tree species. Tree species must be adapted to local agro- ecological conditions, provide a positive balance between their impacts on ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (ED ) , fit farmers' preferences and cater to their needs ( German et al., 2006 ) . Selecting unsuitable shade tree species could on the other hand lead to higher incidence of certain pests and diseases (Bukomeko et al., 2018) or to increased competition with the main crops (Abdulai et al., 2018 ) , resulting in loss of productivity followed by the removal of shade trees. Likewise, farmers will often remove or replace shade trees whose impacts mismatch their needs, for instance shade trees providing environmental benefits but little to no economic incentive (Nath et al., 2016 ) . Shade tree species selection is thus a pivotal step in designing and promoting successful and long lasting agroforestry systems.
Most research and initiatives for shade tree promotion in farming systems have so far focused on a limited number of well- documented tree species (Hastings et al., 2020 ) . These few tree species, albeit often successfully grown in small- scale pilot projects, cannot fit all the various social and ecological conditions needed for scaling up agroforestry practices beyond initial project sites, and thus did not lead to widespread dissemination of promoted agroforestry systems ( Coe et al., 2014 ) . In response, a growing number of studies started advocating the use of participatory methods and increased reliance on farmers' local ecological knowledge (LEK ) . LEK refers to a body of knowledge, practice and belief held by stakeholders, gained through personal observations and interactions with their local ecosystem ( Charnley et al., 2007; Olsson & Folke, 2001 ) . One reason behind the increased reliance on LEK is its complementarity with existing databases and academic knowledge, allowing researchers to screen through large pools of native tree species to identify locally suitable ones (Smith Dumont et al., 2019; Uprety et al., 2012 ) . In addition, the use of participatory methods results in higher levels of engagements from local stakeholders, better fits between agroforestry system designs and farmers' needs, and therefore increased adoption rates (Smith Dumont et al., 2019 ) . Therefore, the use of participatory methods and reliance on LEK to develop locally adapted tree species recommendations is gaining popularity in conservation studies ( Charnley et al., 2007; de Albuquerque et al., 2009 ) , forest restoration studies (Chechina & Hamann, 2015; Fremout et al., 2021) and agroforestry studies (Smith Dumont et al., 2014, 2018 ) . Furthermore, a few digital tools based on LEK have emerged to guide tree species selection (Fremout et al., 2022; Reubens et al., 2011 ) . Yet, LEK studies to guide tree species selection often lack comparability and face methodological challenges to collect LEK (Barber & Jackson, 2015; Thomas et al., 2007 ) , analyse it (Charnley et al., 2007; Gosling & Reith, 2020) and link it to farming practices and all the way to practical recommendations (Uprety et al., 2012; Valencia et al., 2015 ) . There is therefore the need to develop and test robust methodologies to document farmers' LEK with a view to recommending shade tree species tailored to local needs.
Methodologies based on qualitative approaches are well adapted to investigate in- depth knowledge, especially when this knowledge is held only by a few stakeholders, and to map complex interaction networks. Tools such as the Agroecological Knowledge Toolkit (AKT) are specifically designed to generate causal diagrams ( Sinclair & Walker, 1998 ) , useful to disentangle the complex network of interactions within agroforestry systems. Participatory mapping (Tusznio et al., 2020) and narrative field walks (Jerneck & Olsson, 2013; Suárez et al., 2012) are other increasingly popular methods to document farmers' qualitative knowledge. The resulting in- depth understanding can in turn provide knowledge unknown to the academic sphere, such as the classification of shade tree species into “fresh” and “hot” categories documented by Cerdán et al. (2012 ) . It can help identifying and designing farming practices to solve complex issues, such as that of pest regulation ( Liebig et al., 2016 ) . This is especially the case in areas where farmers benefit from long standing farming systems and the associated traditional ecological knowledge (Cerdán et al., 2012; Charnley et al., 2007 ) . As opposed to areas in rapid mutations, such as coffee areas found in southeast Asia (Nguyen et al., 2020; Rigal et al., 2018) where local ecological knowledge is rapidly evolving based on farmers' recent experiences, and cannot be called agroforestry systems versus in full sun; (iii) providing a clear pathway for validation of the results; (iv) using tree species' functional traits to generalize the results.

RIGAL et al. traditional knowledge (Charnley et al., 2007 ) . Finally, qualitative approaches also allow the identification of constraints to the dissemination of results and adoption of practices, such as the lack of access to germplasm (Smith Dumont et al., 2019 ) .
Quantitative approaches in ethnobotany offer another way to study LEK. Numerous indices have been developed to evaluate species attributes from local knowledge such as species' cultural importance or usefulness. Such indices are well suited for quantitative comparisons between species using statistical tools, and identification of species with high potential for recommendations ( de Albuquerque et al., 2009 ) . For instance, Suárez et al. (2012) derived quantitative indices on tree species' usefulness, scarcity and importance for wildlife from interviews to help select tree species for reforestation in Mexico. Fremout et al. (2021) used local knowledge to quantify tree species' usefulness (cultural importance index) and threat status (salience index) for reforestation in the Andes. Brandt et al. (2013) calculated the same indices to evaluate tree species in agroforestry systems in Bolivia. These quantitative methods prove to be especially efficient when the investigated knowledge is shared among large groups of respondents, allowing for statistical approaches, but become of limited use when only few respondents hold the knowledge. Furthermore, these methods are powerful in describing attributes or performances, but not in explaining or investigating causal relationships in complex biotic networks. Qualitative and quantitative approaches thus provide complementary results and can benefit from being combined.
The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology was developed and intended as a standardized methodology to document farmers' knowledge on shade tree species and their provision of ecosystem services (van der Wolf et al., 2016 ) . It partakes in a quantitative approach through the development of alternative indices for tree species' performances. In this methodology, the documentation of farmer's knowledge takes place through rankings of tree species they are most familiar with. Rankings are then converted into scores representing the performances of each shade tree species and allowing their comparisons ( Turner et al., 2020; Turner & Firth, 2012 ) . The methodology was first developed and tested in East Africa (Gram et al., 2017) before being replicated and adapted in West Africa, Southeast Asia and Central America. Importantly, the methodology goes all the way to practical recommendations through an online decision- support tool ( www.shade treea dvice.org ) . Results are uploaded to the online tool and translated into applicable information for farmers and extension agents, guiding the selection of shade tree species tailored to local contexts and individual's preferences. In recent years, several entities spanning development agencies, local governments and private companies expressed their interest in the tool to support the design of local agroforestry programs (personal communications ) , confirming the relevance of the methodology and of the associated online tool.
The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology was applied in eight studies between 2016 and 2020, both in coffee and cocoa growing regions, and results were uploaded online. The article presents these eight ShadeTreeAdvice studies and synthesizes their findings, by nature context- specific, to draw general lessons about farmers' LEK and use of shade tree species. More specifically, this article (i) explores the similarities in shade tree species use and performances across study areas; (ii) investigates the importance of ES as drivers of agroforestry practices and identifies knowledge gaps associated to important ES; ( iii) links LEK to socio- economic and environmental factors. Based on this synthesis, the article then points out the strengths and limitations of the current ShadeTreeAdvice methodology and suggests methodological improvements to deepen and broaden the research scope of future studies. Lastly, feedback from users of the decisionsupport tool are briefly presented along with avenues to improve the tool and expand its use. | MATERIALS AND METHODS .1 | Presentation of ShadeTreeAdvice
The methodology was standardized by van der Wolf et al. (2016) with the following steps: (1) selection of the study area and farming systems; (2) identification of the most important ecosystem services for local farmers through participatory methods; (3) listing of local shade tree species through free listing by farmers and farm inventories; (4) stakeholder interviews and ranking of shade tree species for provision of locally important ES; (5) analysis of ranking data with Bradley- Terry analysis to estimate performances of tree species; (6) comparison of results with existing scientific knowledge. This methodology revolves around two central concepts: the emphasis given to local solutions to solve local challenges (steps 1 to 3) and the search for the right balance between efficiency of data collection and robustness/usefulness of results (steps 4 to 6 ) .
Local ecological knowledge gathered with the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology feeds into a decision- support tool available at www. shade treea dvice.org. The list of studies is displayed on a map and linked with the corresponding articles. In the tool tab, users can select their area, their crop and a set of ES that they consider a priority for their farming system. The tool combines the scores of shade tree species for the selected ES, and displays their rankings in a chart. This allows the user to screen through the list of shade tree species and identify those with high potential to meet specific needs. .2 | ShadeTreeAdvice studies
The present article reviews the results from studies conducted between 2016 and 2020 that follow the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology (Table 1 ) . There were eight studies, spreading across three continents— four studies were carried out in Africa, three in Southeast Asia and one in Central America— and spanning three perennial crops— six studies related to Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica ) , one to Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora var. robusta) and one to cocoa (Theobroma cacao ) . , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

RIGAL et al.
In these studies, the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology was not only used to gather knowledge on shade tree species and feed the decision support tool, but also to investigate site- specific research questions related to LEK and the use of shade tree species in local agroforestry systems. In particular, most studies investigated the link between shade tree performances and environmental factors ( Table 1 ) . In Ghana and Central Uganda, the authors compared the performances of shade tree species in areas of low and of high precipitation, and highlighted nuances in farmer selection and management of shade trees according to precipitation (Bukomeko et al., 2019; Graefe et al., 2017 ) . On Mount Elgon in Uganda and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the authors investigated farmers' priorities and shade tree preferences across elevations (Gram et al., 2017; Wagner et al., 2019 ) . And in the Bolaven Plateau in Laos, Lépine (2018) compared farmers' knowledge and priorities in areas of high and low soil fertility.
The methodology was also used to explore the link between LEK and farming practices or socio- economic factors (Table 1 ) . In Nicaragua, Carpente (2020) investigated farmers' preferences and use of shade trees inside coffee plots versus on plot edges, and compared perceptions of tree species between gender. On Mount Kilimanjaro, Wagner et al. (2019) compared farmers' priorities and knowledge on trees with the actual tree species composition of their farm, with farmers' affiliation to farmer groups and between gender. In Vietnam, Nguyen et al. (2020) investigated farmers' tree species preferences according to gender, ethnicity, their distance to road and access to market. And in Yunnan Province in China, Rigal et al. (2018) researched the emergence and evolution of LEK on shade trees alongside the emergence of large- scale agroforestry landscapes and compared perceptions of tree species between gender, ethnicity.
In the rest of the article, results specific to shade tree species and their provision of ES will only be drawn from the six ShadeTreeAdvice studies focusing on Arabica coffee. This will ease comparison between study sites with similar farming systems. General experiences regarding the methodology, its use and limitations will be drawn from the eight ShadeTreeAdvice studies, including the two studies on Robusta coffee and cocoa. .3 | Shade tree species and their perceived performances
The list of tree species documented across the six ShadeTreeAdvice studies on Arabica coffee was compiled to identify those most commonly used in coffee agroforestry systems in the study areas. Trees were categorized by species, families and classified as either “fruit trees”, “trees for other products (timber, firewood and fodder ) ” or “trees for provision of ecosystem services”, according to their main benefit as defined by farmers. Best performing trees were identified in all study sites based on their scores for three categories of ES listed below, and compared to draw general conclusions between tree species or families, tree attributes and farmers' perceptions. The three categories of ES selected for this analysis were ES related to soil regulation (the category of ES ranked in most studies ) , a second focus on ES related to coffee production (the main economic pillar of coffee farming systems ) , and a third focus on fruit production ( a provisioning service especially important for smallholder farmers ) . .4 | Ecosystem services and knowledge gaps
The list of ES identified as locally important by farmers and documented across the six ShadeTreeAdvice studies on Arabica coffee was compiled. ES were classified into services related to coffee production (coffee yield and quality ) , microclimate regulation (protection from cold and heat ) , soil regulation (soil fertility, soil moisture, root competition, litter provision, erosion control ) , weed control, pests and diseases control, tree products for income generation and/or self- consumption (timber, fuelwood, and fodder on the one hand, fruit as a separate category) and enhancement of biodiversity. In four studies, shade tree species were also ranked for their attributes (suitability of shade provision, tree growth rate and tree adaptation to local growing conditions) and for their impacts on farming practices (need and ease of pruning, impact on fertilizers needs for coffee/cocoa ) . ES, tree attributes and farming practices included in most studies across the six studies on Arabica coffee were identified TA B LE 1 list of the 8 studies conducted using the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology between 2016 and 2020

RIGAL et al. as both locally most relevant to farmers and easily ranked by them. The services, attributes and practices with few rankings were identified as less relevant to farmers, while those pointed out by authors as difficult to rank by farmers were linked to knowledge gaps.
Knowledge gaps were also identified through pairwise comparisons of tree species' scores. Indeed, ES where tree species' scores are most distinct from one another and where standard errors are the smallest reflect high consistency in farmers' rankings. Whereas ES where scores are similar and standard errors are the highest reflected disagreements among farmer rankings, therefore hinting at knowledge gaps. For each study site and ES, the percentage of significantly different scores were calculated using pairwise comparisons of tree species' scores with the Wald test. These percentages were averaged across the new classification of ES listed above, providing an indicator of depth and consistency of farmers' perceptions of tree species. .5 | Linking LEK to socio- economic groups and environmental factors
All studies investigated specific aspects of the relationship between farmers' priorities, their perceptions and/or their farming practices between various socio- economic groups and along environmental gradients. To do so, authors attempted various types of comparisons and correlations between locally important ES, tree species rankings and farm compositions between groups of farmers and under contrasted environmental conditions. We listed these attempts and compared their outcomes, to review the potential for the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology to investigate sources and drivers of farmers' LEK through a quantitative approach. Furthermore, we detail the methods used by authors to select their respondents and discuss the impacts of their sampling methods. .6 | Improvements in ShadeTreeAdvice
Since the inception of the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology in 2016 (van der Wolf et al., 2016) researchers and practitioners have identified its strenghts and been confronted with its limitations. They tested improvements through trials and errors, notably to help investigating sources and drivers of LEK, to test robust methods of validation of the results, or to further convert the results into practical recommendations to farmers. Based on their feedback, we review the limitations and suggest a series of improvements in the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology to better guide practitioners in future studies. Furthermore, we discuss feedback received from users of the decision- support tool and suggest avenues to improve it and contribute to its better integration in the design of agroforestry programs. | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Studies following the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology are by definition grounded in a local context, reflecting the fact that farming systems, shade tree species and LEK are all context specific. In particular, LEK is specific to a set of environmental conditions, local practices and perceptions, and should not be taken out of its context (Charnley et al., 2007; Tebboth et al., 2020; Tusznio et al., 2020 ) . Keeping in mind the challenges inherent to a review of studies grounded in local contexts and the limits of LEK comparison, we highlight in this section general findings in line with the common comprehension of tropical agroforestry systems and with studies pertaining to LEK and tree species, thus demonstrating the relevancy and reliability of the ShadeTreeAdvice approach. .1 | Shade tree species and their perceived performances
Ecological conditions, partial use of indigenous tree species, socio- economic factors, and access to market all lead to a huge variety in tree species used between different study sites (a total of 135 different species in the six studies on Coffea arabica ) . This makes comparisons on species level challenging, as only eight tree species are present in more than two study sites. One approach consists in comparing at family levels instead. When comparing the five highest ranked tree species for soil regulatory services between the studies, Fabaceae and Moraceae were identified as the most common families found in five different countries (Figure 1 ) . Fabaceae is a large, diverse and widely distributed family. It is not only the most common family for the highest ranked tree species for soil regulatory services but, with 23 different species (17% of all species ) , it is also the most common family in the rankings of all studies. Albizia schimperiana and Leucaena leucocephala, the highest ranked tree species for soil regulatory services in Tanzania and Vietnam belong to this family.

RIGAL et al. the Fabaceae family is a feature frequently observed in smallholder coffee farming systems (Hundera, 2016; Tscharntke et al., 2011 ) , explained by their ability to form atmospheric nitrogen- fixing symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria and contribute to soil fertility. Their leaves, usually being compound, also provide light shade conditions suitable for coffee. Two other tree species were noticeable. Bischofia javanica, which belongs to the diverse family Phyllanthaceae, was the highest ranked tree species in China and Laos for improving soil fertility. The crown of B. javanica is denser but was perceived as beneficial to soil fertility due to high amounts of leaf litter and increased nutrient cycling (Rigal et al., 2019 ) . Cordia africana (family Boraginaceae) was the highest ranked tree species for improving soil fertility in Uganda and is known for providing good mulch.
Rankings of tree species were quite similar within study sites for services related to soil regulation as discussed above, coffee production (yield, quality, and life expectancy of coffee trees ) , and the tree attribute “providing good quality shade”. If a tree species was ranked in the top five for one of these services or tree attributes, it was very often also ranked high for the two others. In Tanzania and Uganda, this was the case for four of the five tree species, and in Laos, Vietnam and Nicaragua, for two. The highest ranked species was also the same for all selected ES in Tanzania (A. schimperiana ) , Uganda (C. africana ) , and Vietnam (L. leucocephala ) . These tree species were also frequently highly ranked for other ES not directly linked with coffee production. This raised the question of whether these tree species are exceptional in providing several beneficial services or if their high ranking is due to biases in farmers' perceptions. The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology could not always help clarify this point. Further comparison with existing academic knowledge when possible, or comparison of perceptions between groups of farmers potentially less prone to biases, could help clarify this point in future studies.
Fruit trees were frequently ranked in the studies, not surprisingly considering that farmers ranked fruit provision as an important ES in four out of six ShadeTreeAdvice studies (Table 2 ) . When categorized under the most important benefit they provide (trees for fruits, trees for other products or trees for ecosystem services ) , between 20% and 68% of the ranked species in every study sites belonged to the fruit tree category, with 44 different species overall (and 33% of all species) (Figure 2 ) . The four shade tree species most common across studies were all fruit trees, confirming their importance and showing that they are more widely spread across the world compared to other tree species. Psidium guajava and Mangifera indica were ranked in all six studies. Persea americana and Artocarpus heterophyllus were also widespread and ranked in five studies, with Persea americana only absent in China and A. heterophyllus only absent in Nicaragua. Several Citrus spp. were included in the rankings making this genus the most common, even though none was ranked in Uganda or China. This genus was followed by Musa, Psidium, Persea, Ficus and Mangifera, all ranked on all three continents.
Some differences between countries can be observed. Vietnam had a much higher proportion of fruit trees than other countries (68% ) .

RIGAL et al. explain why farmers in Vietnam prioritize the production of fruits over ecosystem services. Another contributing factor is favourable government policies. With economic benefits being the most important driver for the majority of farmers in this region, some farmers plan to replace coffee with fruit trees when fruits are more profitable than coffee. Other tree products (timber, firewood, and fodder) were not a priority in China, Vietnam and Laos (Table 2 ) . The proportion of these tree species was below 30% in these countries, while it was above % for Nicaragua, Uganda and Tanzania. This shows the influence of farmers' priorities and socio- economic conditions on the selection of tree species. The history of farming systems is another important factor. One scenario is the transition from monocrop to agroforestry system with farmers actively deciding which tree species to plant. This selection can also be influenced by promotions, for example the “Lao Upland Development Project” promoted local legume trees for shade (Lépine, 2018 ) , which might contribute to the high proportion of trees solely for ecosystem services. Another setting is the transition from formerly forested land. Here, farmers decide on which trees to remove. In this scenario, it could happen that more tree species providing ecosystem services remain on the farm, which might have been the case for Uganda. This setting is also common in farming systems where trees can regenerate naturally. The choice becomes then more opportunistic in nature, compared to farming systems where purposeful planting of seedlings is the norm. For the latter, the choice of trees is more directly linked with the benefits and ecosystem services sought by the farmer. This was especially the case in Uganda. .2 | Ecosystem services and knowledge gaps
The number rankings for tree products, whether food, timber and other non- timber tree products, highlights the importance of provisioning services (Table 2 ) . It emphasizes the importance of economic benefits in farmers' priorities, sometimes over environmental benefits (Chechina & Hamann, 2015; German et al., 2006 ) , and calls for widening the methodology beyond sole environmental services to better capture and reflect farmers' needs (Nath et al., 2016; Tusznio et al., 2020 ) . More generally, the diversity of rankings considered locally important by farmers corroborates a holistic vision of their farming systems and supports their preferences for multipurpose tree species (Mekoya et al., 2008 ) .
Ecosystem services related to soil regulation were the most common in the six LEK studies on Arabica coffee, with a total of 18 rankings (Table 2 ) . Yet, only one study specifically mentioned competition from root systems. Most indicators related to litter and soil erosion, therefore visible indicators, hinting at a knowledge gap on belowground impacts and root distribution (Reubens et al., 2011 ) . ES related to coffee production, which encompassed coffee yield, coffee quality and life expectancy of coffee trees, were only ranked a total of 8 times despite their major importance for coffee farmers. This low number of rankings can partly be explained by difficulties to rank the impacts of shade trees on coffee quality (Rigal et al., 2018) and could indicate a knowledge gap in coffee producing regions, where farmers either do not drink coffee or are not economically incentivized to produce high quality coffee. The impact of shade trees on pests and diseases is of particular importance as it was reported as a major concern in all study areas. However, rankings could not be conducted in China and Nicaragua, due to knowledge gaps. Only two rankings were reported in Uganda, and they highlighted the difficulty of conducting rankings for these regulatory services due to challenges in the analysis.
Pairwise comparisons of tree species' scores using Wald tests provided another pathway to confirm the above knowledge gaps. The lower this percentage, the more inconsistencies in farmers' rankings FI G U R E 2 Proportion of trees providing fruits, trees providing products other than fruits (timber, fuelwood, and fodder ) , and trees providing other ecosystem services (soil fertility improvement, provision of shade cover, etc.) in the studied countries , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

RIGAL et al. and perceptions of tree species impacts. Even within the ecosystem services related to soil regulation, differences can be observed. An overall similar perception among farmers and high agreement on the higher performances of some shade tree species over others was indicated for mulch provision (an average of 77% ± 9% of all pairwise comparisons of tree species scores were significantly distinct [four rankings] ) . This was also indicated for erosion control (average of % ± 5% [four rankings] ) , while there was less agreement among farmers for root competition (only 62% [one ranking] ) , confirming that visible ES were easier to rank, while belowground ES were more often associated to knowledge gaps. The same analysis conducted on regulation of pests and diseases provides another example of the way pairwise comparison can support the identification or confirmation of knowledge gaps. The rankings related to pest and disease regulation brought the least information on shade tree species impact, with an average of only 59% ± 2% of all pairwise comparisons being significantly distinct (two rankings ) . Therefore, this result supports the fact that there is a knowledge gap on the impact of shade tree species on pests and diseases regulation, and that further research in these complex biotic networks is needed to fill these gaps and complement LEK (Liebig et al., 2016; Mistry & Berardi, 2016 ) . .3 | Linking LEK to socio- economic groups and environmental factors
In order to ensure the reliability of LEK and of subsequent recommendations from the online tool, priority should be given to gathering knowledge from local experts rather than from a pool of respondents representative of the study area (Davis & Wagner, 2003; Ruddle & Davis, 2013 ) . These local experts should be agroforesters with first- hand experience of ES provision by shade trees. The richer the respondents' experience, the more comprehensive the results ( Cerdán et al., 2012 ) . Most ShadeTreeAdvice studies relied on existing databases of cooperatives, NGO programs, and certification schemes to identify smallholder farmers with agroforestry systems, considered local experts (Table 3 ) . Extension workers provided an alternative source of contact information to identify local experts. One consequence is that interviewed farmers are often better linked to market and international projects than average farmers in the study area. This could have an influence on the LEK as well since these farmers could be influenced by tree species promotion or the knowledge of the extension service. Most studies then used random sampling techniques to extract a sample of farmers from within these databases of local experts, or used semi- random techniques to include representatives of major socio- economic and demographic groups in their sample, often with a specific focus on gender (Table 3 ) . Characterizing cultural, socio- economic, and demographic groups is important since LEK is known to be associated with criteria such as gender (Ayantunde et al., 2008 ) , age or migration (Mathez- Stiefel et al., 2012 ) , and ethnicity (Yuan et al., 2014 ) . It can also be associated with farming practices, as shown by Cerdán et al. (2012) who pointed out a deeper understanding of trees' TA B LE 3 characterization of respondents in the 8 studies conducted between 2016 and 2020

RIGAL et al. impacts from organic farmers than conventional farmers. Not only LEK but also preferences and priorities are related to respondents, as Tebboth et al. (2020) pointed out with their study on invasive species and the fact that ES can simultaneously be considered beneficial by some stakeholders and detrimental by others. Farmers with land tenure issues and low access to market will also exhibit different priorities than farmers in less vulnerable states (Nath et al., 2016 ) . Characterizing these factors and understanding the differences in perceptions and priorities associated with them helps to tailor recommendations to answer farmers' specific needs. To carry out this analysis under the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology, researchers can run separate Bradley- Terry or Plackett- Luce analyses on subgroups and compare the resulting tree species' scores, or directly add covariables into the mathematical model (Turner et al., 2020; Turner & Firth, 2012 ) . This depth of analysis corroborates the use of the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology to document LEK, and can help researchers validate their results and recommendations.
Following this method, ShadeTreeadvice studies highlighted the many differences in perceptions and priorities between socioeconomic groups. For instance, ethnicity was related to differences in perceptions and preferences in China (Rigal et al., 2018 ) : farmers from mountainous ethnicities were more eager to select indigenous tree species than farmers from lowland ethnicities, even though they perceived higher belowground competition from these tree species than farmers from lowland ethnicities did. In Tanzania, women perceived Musa spp as more beneficial for soil fertility while men preferred Rauvalfia caffra for the same ES (Wagner et al., 2019) while, in Nicaragua, women had more difficulties than men to rank tree species for soil fertility (Carpente, 2020 ) . In Vietnam, proximity to roads was the most important factor influencing the overall preference of shade tree species: farmers in close proximity to roads and hence market access mostly selected fruit tree species, while farmers in more remote areas preferred timber and N- fixing tree species (Nguyen et al., 2020 ) . On the other hand, ShadeTreeAdvice studies rarely discussed land tenure status and farmers' linkage to market and extension services ( Table 3 ) . Researchers using ShadeTreeAdvice should carefully document these aspects in future studies, and better characterize the social, economic, and cultural context prior to selecting their pool of local experts. The pool of local experts does not need to be perfectly representative of the community. Gathering reliable and accurate LEK is the first priority of the methodology. Yet, the gathered LEK must result in tailored recommendations for wealthier farmers as well as more vulnerable or marginalized farmers.
Differences in priorities and perceptions were also related to agroecological conditions. For instance on Mount Elgon in Uganda, farmers at high elevation gave higher priority to mulch provision and erosion control while farmers at low elevation gave higher priority to microclimate regulation (Gram et al., 2017 ) . In Laos, differences in species preferences were associated with soil fertility, with the N- fixing Erythrina ovalifolia better ranked in more fertile areas ( Lépine, 2018 ) .
This quantitative methodology proved suitable to study differences in perceptions among groups of farmers. Yet, its accuracy diminishes when running analyses on subgroups with few individuals and rankings. This could explain the difficulty to detect differences between men's and women's perceptions and preferences (Lunelli et al., 2016; Sari et al., 2020 ) , especially considering the difficulty of having genderbalanced pools of interviewees. Only two studies relying on the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology detected differences (Carpente, 2020; Rigal et al., 2018 ) . In future studies, the addition of a last ranking dedicated to overall preferences (section 3.4.3) should help highlight differences in gender priorities (Meemken et al., 2017 ) . New mathematical models to identify clusters of respondents based on their rankings could also prove fruitful in this regard (Biernacki & Jacques, 2013 ) .
Lastly, while analysing the differences in priorities and perceptions, attention must be paid to potential collective biases from respondents. Quantitative approaches allow the comparison of LEK between different groups of farmers and can help identify biases and knowledge gaps during the validation process (Rigal et al., 2018 ) . However, this approach is limited and must be complemented with qualitative statements from farmers to identify the sources of their LEK in an attempt to identify potential biases. This was particularly evidenced in China and Laos, where it was shown that promotion campaigns of shade tree species had a strong impact on farmers' preferences and perceptions. In China, farmers had a positive bias for the nine shade tree species promoted by local governments despite their competitiveness with coffee (Rigal et al., 2018 ) . In Laos, farmers ranked E. ovalifolia much higher than any other shade tree species for all ES, partly as a result of past programs promoting that species and of its current widespread use (Lépine, 2018 ) . This difficulty to identify collective biases calls for improved methodological steps to validate the results. .4 | Improvements
The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology successfully allowed the collection and analysis of farmers' perceptions of over 160 tree species and eight categories of ES in the eight study areas (Table 1 ) . These studies therefore demonstrated the relevance and efficiency of this methodology in documenting LEK to recommend shade tree species. Yet, this review also shows the need to further improve the methodology. The methodology would particularly benefit from clear steps to gather more comprehensive LEK and validate the results. According to researchers and extension services, it would also be beneficial to convert tree species' scores into sharper recommendations for farmers on the ShadeTreeAdvice online tool. Here, we suggest a series of four methodological modifications directly applicable in future studies and discuss the need for future improvements to the online tool. .4.1 | Comparing the tree performances against performances in the absence of shade trees
The scores resulting from the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology allow the comparison of tree species' performances, to assess which species provide the most of a targeted ES and which provide the least. In , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

RIGAL et al. the context of an agroforestry system, the ShadeTreeAdvice tool can therefore help identify the best- suited shade tree species. However, it does not offer a comparison point with a monoculture system without shade trees. In the context of conversion from monoculture to agroforestry, it cannot help assessing whether or not this conversion will be beneficial for a set of targeted ES. In other words, the scores do not inform farmers whether coffee or cocoa agroforestry systems will perform better or worse than in the absence of shade trees, equivalent to a monoculture scenario.
This point can be illustrated by shade tree species' impact on coffee production on Mount Elgon, Uganda. Based on recent ecophysiological models (Rahn et al., 2018 ) , shade is known to be beneficial for yield at low elevations in this mountainous region. We can therefore infer that coffee yield would be higher under C. africana, the tree species with the highest scores for coffee yield, than in monoculture systems. But would it still be higher under Terminalia ivorensis or P. americana (two species with low to medium scores for coffee yield) than in monoculture systems? Current information from ShadeTreeAdvice studies does not give users information in this regard.
A simple change in step 3 of the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology can yield this information in future studies. In past studies, interviewees selected and ranked up to 10 cards representing tree species with which they were familiar. In future studies, we suggest that interviewees select an additional card representing the absence of shade trees. Ranking exercises can proceed with this new set of cards. In this new configuration, the Bradley- Terry (Turner & Firth, 2012) or Plackett- Luce (Turner et al., 2020) analysis will attribute scores and standard deviations to the absence of shade tree, reflecting the performances of a monoculture scenario for the chosen set of ES. In this new configuration, monoculture (equivalent to the absence of shade trees) can serve as a reference: tree species ranking higher than monoculture systems provide services, whereas tree species ranking lower than monoculture systems provide disservices (Figure 3 ) . This change would benefit not only the end users with more precise information; it would also add a reference point to ease the comparison between tree species' scores and scientific studies on shade tree provision of ES. Therefore easing the validation of the results. .4.2 | Going beyond ecosystem services with farming practices
One of the underlying assumptions behind the rankings of shade tree species for locally important ES is that ES are the main drivers for shade tree species selection. Yet, they are not the sole drivers of shade tree species selection. Bukomeko et al. (2019 ) , highlighted the fact that the ES selected in their study did not always match farmers' needs. Wagner et al. (2019) also emphasized the importance of taking into account the history of farming systems as well as more decision- making criteria to understand farmer choices and on- farm tree diversity. In both studies, the set of prioritized ES only partly explained on- farm tree diversity. We therefore suggest widening the rankings to any objective deemed relevant by local farmers, and in particular to the impact of shade trees on farming practices. For instance, intercropping coffee with fruit trees requires additional management of fertilizer and pesticide inputs, pruning, and harvesting, which raises the issue of labor availability during harvest seasons. Fast growing tree species like L. leucocephala decrease the labor needed for field weeding, but require regular pruning and thinning to control shade and the many offsprings. These management factors influence farmers' selection of fruit trees or other tree species they intercrop with coffee, and should therefore be included in the tree selection tool alongside the tree species provision of ES.
Two studies on the need for fertilizers in Vietnam and ease of pruning in Nicaragua have already started investigating the impact of shade tree species on farming practices. These studies show that the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology is well suited to score shade tree species not only for their provision of locally important ES but also for their impact on farming practices. Only step 2 of the methodology needs to be adapted to accommodate this change. While identifying locally important ES, researchers should also identify the locally important farming practices impacted by shade trees. Importantly, researchers should pay attention that the identification of locally relevant ES and farming practices covering the priorities of all farmers in the study area, including vulnerable and marginalized ones. The rest of the methodology remains unchanged. We therefore advocate for future studies to better balance tree rankings on the provision of ES and their impacts on farming practices, in order to better reflect the needs of farmers and their main decisionmaking criteria. This is especially important in intensive farming regions such as in Southeast Asia, where short- term economic benefits and labor availability are key constraints, and often influence tree species selection more than their impact on soil fertility or microclimate regulation. .4.3 | Validation of results
After the collection and analysis of LEK, a thorough validation process of the results must ensure accurate recommendations to farmers (Ruddle & Davis, 2013 ) . Researchers shall keep in mind that LEK represents an autonomous body of knowledge and that the validation process should not be seen as a mere validation of LEK by scientific standards (Mistry & Berardi, 2016; Uprety et al., 2012 ) . Still, marked dissimilarities between LEK and academic or expert knowledge should raise a flag passed on to end- users to present the various points of view, in order to give them all the elements guiding their decision- making process. These flags could equally reflect differences in tree performances between studies due to differences in local conditions (Liebig et al., 2016 ) , differences in perceptions due to differences in priorities among stakeholders (Tebboth et al., 2020 ) , collective bias in perceptions (Valencia et al., 2015) , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

People and Nature
RIGAL et al. as they could reflect scientific mistakes (Fremout et al., 2021) or knowledge gaps and the need for further research on a specific topic ( Mistry & Berardi, 2016 ) .
The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology already provides numerous avenues for validation of the results. The first lies in the quantification of tree performances through scores associated with standard errors (Turner & Firth, 2012 ) . The standard errors are indicators of uncertainties, either highlighting knowledge shared among only few respondents or discrepancies in perceptions among the respondents. The comparison of LEK between different groups of respondents is a second avenue for validation as it can help point out disagreements and biases in perceptions (Cerdán et al., 2012; Rigal et al., 2018 ) . Previous ShadeTreeAdvice studies have also often conducted focus group discussions at the end of the study, to present, discuss and validate the results with communities in the study area. Yet, the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology lacks clear guidelines to do so.
We suggest two new methods to guide the validation of results, based on trials and errors from previous studies. The first method consists in checking whether the results from the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology can link farmers' priorities with their current farming systems. To do so, researchers check if tree species present on the farm, and identified through on- farm inventory, display high scores for the ES considered priorities by the farmer. The second method consists in checking whether the recommendations from the ShadeTreeAdvice tools are relevant in the case of a conversion from monoculture to agroforestry. To do so, researchers include an additional ranking exercise in step 4, equivalent to farmers' overall tree species preference if given a new monoculture plot. Researchers then check if the preferred tree species match the tree species identified by the ShadeTreeAdvice tool given the respondents' set of priorities for this new plot.
Marked differences between ShadeTreeAdvice outputs and farmers' current practice or overall preferences would highlight disagreements in shade tree species' scores and perceived performances, or most likely indicate the omission of important decision- making criteria for selecting and keeping shade tree species. The identification of important yet omitted decision- making criteria would require researchers to go back to step 2, and raise the importance of going beyond sole rankings for ES as drivers of tree species selection. .4.4 | Investigating functional traits
The ShadeTreeAdvice methodology enables documenting a wide range of tree species, including species known by farmers but not documented from field trial experiments. However, the methodology does not enable documenting the least common tree species, those for which farmers have little to no experience. Another limitation lies in that it is hard to compare farmers' perceptions between study sites, as only a few tree species are common between study sites, the majority being fruit tree species. Even the scores of the common fruit tree species cannot be easily compared between study sites, as scores are only meaningful when compared to other species ranked in the same study area, under similar growing conditions, and in similar farming systems. This results for example in M. indica being ranked within the top five tree species for improving coffee production, soil fertility, and shade cover in Vietnam, while it was ranked lower in other countries. Lastly, the scores indicate tree species performances but they do not explain why some tree species perform better than others.
One solution to complement the methodology and accommodate the above limitations could be to look at functional traits of the different tree species. If correlations between functional traits and provision of certain ES are drawn, functional traits could be used as a proxy for explaining and extending the findings of future ShadeTreeAdvice studies toward the least common shade tree species (Funk et al., 2017; Lamond et al., 2016; Smith Dumont et al., 2018 ) . They could also be used as reference points to allow FI G U R E 3 Illustration of scores after the addition of a card representing the absence of shade tree during rankings. The scores include coffee monoculture as a reference point to determine whether shade tree species have a positive or negative impact on the selected ecosystem service , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] . See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | People and Nature
RIGAL et al. for better comparisons between study sites. For instance, it appears that A. schimperiana, L. leucocephala, and E. ovalifolia, all belonging to the Fabaceae Family, dominated the rankings across the studies for improving coffee production (yield and quality ) , providing shade, and improving soil fertility (improving soil moisture and providing good quality mulch ) . The functional traits of this family, especially the capacity to fix nitrogen and provide homogenous shade cover through composite leaves, seem to be very beneficial for inclusion in coffee agroforestry systems. It hints that other tree species from the Fabaceae family, with similar functional traits, could have similar impacts. Furthermore, the highest ranked tree species in China for coffee production (Phyllanthus emblica) has very small leaves and hence might provide a similar shade cover as many species of the Fabaceae family. Lastly, comparing the relationships between functional traits and provision of ES derived from LEK with those displayed in academic studies would provide a last avenue for validation of the results (Hastings et al., 2020; Hundera, 2016 ) . Through a finer understanding of farmers' LEK, these relationships could also help explain discrepancies in perceptions if these arise from the new validation process suggested in step 6. In future studies, we advise investigating the tree functional traits and their relationship with ES and farming practices through focus group discussions, expert interviews, or by conducting a literature review during the validation step.
In its current version, the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology already leads to the collection of qualitative knowledge during interviews, when farmers are asked to comment on their rankings. It not only allows the interviewers to ensure that interviewees have understood the ranking exercise, but also reveals some of the links between tree performances and tree attributes, and refines the understanding of farmers' drivers for tree selection and management practices (Lamond et al., 2016 ) . The methodology therefore already results in the collection functional traits and tree attributes, however it does not currently provide room for the management of this ecological knowledge and these comments are neither used in the statistical analysis nor documented and displayed in the current version of the ShadeTreeAdvice website. Given appropriate time, researchers could combine the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology with the AKT methodology to combine quantitative with qualitative analysis. Indeed, Smith Dumont et al. (2018) effectively combined both approaches in Rwanda, using the AKT tool to map the interactions between tree attributes and coffee yield, and analysing rankings of tree attributes to identify shade tree species compatible with high coffee productivity.
All of the above improvements to the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology are summarized in Figure 4. .5 | Practical recommendations from LEK and the decision- support tool
Most studies on LEK point out the depth of knowledge of practitioners and call for better integration of their LEK into policies and restoration programs (de Albuquerque et al., 2009 ) . Yet, only a few studies go all the way to practical recommendations and decisionsupport tools (Fremout et al., 2021; Reubens et al., 2011; Uprety et al., 2012 ) . Since the inception of the ShadeTreeAdvice methodology, results of the studies have been uploaded online to feed such a decision- support tool and help farmers select shade tree species. A thorough validation process of the results is a prerequisite to uploading the results online (Ruddle & Davis, 2013 ) . The tool then allows users to select a set of ES representing farmers' needs. It combines the scores of shade tree species for this set of ES and displays the results in a chart. Users can use this chart as a starting point, screening through the list of tree species to select a combination of species that provide a good balance in terms of performances for the set of select ES. Results from the eight initial studies show that best performing tree species depend on the set of selected ES, therefore confirming that shade tree selection needs to be tailored to match farmers' needs (Bukomeko et al., 2019; Meemken et al., 2017 ) . Tree species providing good trade- offs among ES often rank higher than species maximizing one ES at the expense of other services, therefore corroborating the fact that multipurpose tree species are favoured (Cerdán et al., 2012; Mekoya et al., 2008 ) . Lastly, it also confirms that several tree species often provide similar trade- offs, thus showing that there is no single best tree species, and that recommendations should emphasize combinations of tree species ( Tscharntke et al., 2011 ) .
In its current form, the tool is not tailored to be directly used by end- beneficiaries of the solutions (farmers ) . It is better suited to trained extension agents who can subsequently make recommendations to farmers, based on their livelihood needs. Eventually, recommendations from the tool could also be used in the setup of shade tree nurseries or in the development of a landscape strategy that goes beyond the individual farmers to tackle challenges such as soil conservation in a hot spot prone to erosion, or connectivity between patches of protected areas (Lake et al., 2018; Vaast et al., 2005 ) . In fact, there are many potential users for such a tool. As a web- based tool, the assumption that smallholder farmers will be the major users might ultimately be wrong since the majority of smallholder farmers do not have internet access. Furthermore, the information from the tool is currently only accessible in English. Early users based in China already identified that language and the lack of local names could be major barriers to using the tool. User research to identify the needs, difficulties, and barriers of the target users, and package information into something useful is fundamental in order to design a tool that will ultimately be beneficial for farmers. It can be based on methods such as human- centered design and participatory experiments with short learning loops (Kenny et al., 2021 ) .
Current feedback from users already hint at the need for recommendations on management practices, and more specifically in planting density and suitable level of shade. While there is no straightforward answer, as suitable levels of shade are context specific (Rahn et al., 2018 ) , there is potential to add recommendations on farming practices and spatial arrangements based on LEK, such as spacing between trees, tree thinning as they mature, or species more , 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10374 by Montpellier SupAgro, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] . See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | 1245
People and Nature
RIGAL et al. suitable as hedgerows (Charnley et al., 2007; Mariel et al., 2021 ) . In future versions of the ShadeTreeAdvice tool, recommendations for combinations of shade tree species should also be completed with recommendations for relevant temporal designs. The temporal design should maximize the benefits along the system lifespan, hence not only in the long run but also during the initial stages of the conversion toward agroforestry. For example, short- cycle annual crops or fast- growing oil palms planted alongside cocoa trees can rapidly control competitive weeds, while other native shade tree species are established to build up a suitable tree canopy in the longer run ( Jagoret et al., 2012 ) . Considering that access to germplasm is another common limitation to planting tree species (Smith Dumont et al., 2019 ) , information on seed collection and propagation could also be added (Fremout et al., 2022 ) . More generally, the tool could be linked to existing tree libraries, such as the ICRAF tree library ( http://db.world agrof orest ry.org/ ) , to retrieve additional information about tree species. Lastly, the map of ShadeTreeAdvice studies could indicate ecological zones to help users select the environmental factors closest to their conditions whenever this choice is given.
Finally, the current version of the tool provides a snapshot of farmers' needs and farmers' perceptions of shade tree species performances at the time of the study. Considering that LEK is known to be dynamic and that farmers' perceptions are likely to evolve with time (Charnley et al., 2007 ) , for instance through changes in their farming systems and local contexts or with the introduction of new candidate species in the area (de Albuquerque, 2006 ) , there is a need to make the tool more dynamic. This is corroborated by the fact that farmers' needs and constraints are also likely to evolve with time, and that new challenges are likely to appear, especially with climate change or the spread of new pests and diseases (Bukomeko et al., 2018 ) . For these reasons, future versions of the ShadeTreeAdvice tool should encompass a digital space where practitioners using the tool can enter feedback. Feedback would be accessible to subsequent users and supplement the results, based on initial perceptions of tree performances at the time of the study, with additional information useful to put them into perspective. | CONCLUSION
The initial eight ShadeTreeAdvice studies validate the original objectives of the methodology and associated tool. The methodology succeeds in providing an efficient way to gather and analyse farmers' local ecological knowledge, and to feed the results into a decision- support tool to make tailored recommendations of tree species that cater to needs and constraints in agroforestry systems. This method quickly provides reliable foundations for a diversity of tree species and their impacts on a wide range of ES. Further studies, and in particular agronomic and botanical experiments, can afterward complement the results and focus on filling in specific issues raised by knowledge gaps. The eight studies also validate the suitability of the method in a diversity of farming systems based on perennial crops (Arabica coffee, Robusta coffee and cocoa insofar ) , and in a variety of locations, social, cultural and agroecological contexts across continents.
Based on these experiences, we advise simple changes and adjustments to further improve the methodology, without increasing its FI G U R E 4 Flow chart of the improved ShadeTreeAdvice methodology.

RIGAL et al. overall complexity nor significantly increasing the time necessary to conduct the study: (i) adding one element to represent coffee monoculture as a reference in the rankings; (ii) extending the scope of tree impacts beyond that of ecosystem services to farming practices; ( iii) using tree functional traits as an avenue to generalize results; ( iv) adding a ranking step to reflect overall tree species preferences and farmers' priorities to validate the results. Lastly, we recommend researchers to better document the social, economic, and cultural aspects of the study areas prior to selecting respondents, and keep a critical eye on the links between LEK and the socio- economic and cultural characterization of respondents. New studies are already underway testing these improvements, while further extending the ShadeTreeAdvice database (www.shade treea dvice.org ) .
Future avenues for improvement should focus on the decisionsupport tool itself, to better reflect the dynamic nature of both agroforestry systems and local ecological knowledge. In addition, its design should be more user- oriented, keeping in mind that primary users are not necessarily farmers but more likely public and private extension services, NGOs an,d tree nursery managers. With these improvements, ShadeTreeAdvice can eventually develop into an even more efficient method for the promotion of tailored agroforestry systems across locations and perennial cropping systems.

Abstract . Rodent pests can have major social, economic, and environmental impacts. Their management, therefore, represents a complex socio- ecological problem involving a network of stakeholders from across different sectors, with diverging and sometimes competing interests. Failure to incorporate stakeholder interests can result in ineffective or unsustainable management programmes, with unintended negative consequences for people and nature. . Participatory approaches to decision- making have been proposed as suitable strategies to tackle complex problems, yet, these processes are often considered too difficult, costly, or time- consuming to implement. . To facilitate a participatory approach to rodent control in Madagascar, we identified and mapped key stakeholders and developed a multisector framework for guiding rodent management programmes based on current literature and expert recommendations. We then carried out interviews and focus groups with stakeholders and end- users to validate the final framework. . The final framework unifies stakeholder interests around the dimensions of People, Resources, Knowledge and Power. Combined application of the stakeholder map and framework provides decision- makers with the tools to identify stakeholder interests; to explore areas of conflict, as well as areas of agreement; and to ensure that these are addressed within the design of control programmes. As an assessment tool, the framework can also be used to evaluate the responsiveness of programmes to the needs of different stakeholders and assess whether objectives are being reached. . We recommend the application of the stakeholder map and framework to encourage and strengthen participatory approaches aimed at rodent pest control. Due to the inclusive and interdisciplinary nature of the framework, it can be applied to address numerous complex social, environmental, and economic issues across scales, sectors, and systems. | People and Nature
SCOBIE et al. | INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, the proliferation of invasive rodents has severe implications for public health, food security and biodiversity loss. Pre- and post- harvest losses to rodent pests contribute to malnutrition and global food insecurity (Meerburg, Singleton, et al., 2009 ) . Rodents also contaminate stored food, attack livestock, and damage infrastructure (Constant et al., 2020; Stenseth et al., 2003 ) . Furthermore, rodents are reservoirs for over 60 zoonotic diseases transmissible to humans and animals, with catastrophic implications for the most vulnerable communities (Meerburg, Singleton, et al., 2009 ) .
Due to their significant and widespread impacts, rodent pest management represents a complex socio- ecological problem involving stakeholders from across different sectors (Huan et al., 2010; Makundi et al., 1999; Palis et al., 2010 ) . A major challenge in addressing complex problems is the need to incorporate the diverse and sometimes competing interests of different stakeholders (Parrott, 2017 ) . By establishing multi- stakeholder relationships and actively engaging with end- users, participatory approaches have helped to tackle complex problems within the fields of public health (e.g. van Limburg et al., 2015; van Woezik et al., 2016; Wentzel et al., 2012) and invasive species management (e.g. Crowley et al., 2017; García- Llorente et al., 2008; Novoa et al., 2018; Shackleton et al., 2015 ) . In rodent management, there is a need for approaches which integrate the complexity of rodent pest issues whilst being inclusive of the diverse interests of multi- sectoral and multi- scale stakeholders (Constant et al., 2020; Makundi & Massawe, 2011; Palis et al., 2011; Singleton et al., 2004; Swanepoel et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2008 ) .
In Madagascar, rodent pests are primarily perceived as a public health concern due to endemic plague (Andrianaivoarimanana et al., 2013; Constant et al., 2020 ) . Madagascar's Ministry of Health thus makes recommendations for rodent pest control following advice from partners including the World Health Organization and the Pasteur Institute. Their interest centres on reducing plague risk, particularly through minimizing contact between humans and plague vectors (i.e. rodents and their fleas ) . Indeed, following a particularly severe plague outbreak in 2017, there has been renewed interest in understanding the role of rodent control in plague prevention strategies (Belmain et al., 2018; Vallès et al., 2020 ) .
However, rodent pests also threaten food security in the country ( Harvey et al., 2014 ) . Rats in particular are estimated to have caused pre- harvest losses of over 100,000 tonnes of paddy rice in 2021 ( Duplantier & Rakotondravony, 1999; FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ) , 2021 ) . Madagascar's Ministry of Agriculture, therefore, has an interest in rodent control; they make management recommendations based on research conducted at the National Centre of Applied Research for Rural Development ( FOFIFA) and have traditionally advocated the use of lethal methods (Direction de la Protection des Végétaux, Antananarivo, pers. commun. ) .
Despite their impact, effective rodent pest management has not been established in Madagascar. Control programmes have involved little collaboration between different stakeholders and typically focus on managing plague outbreaks rather than prevention. There is also continued dependence on non- selective methods, such as lethal traps and poisons, which impact non- target species and the environment. Both Ministries are hindered by a lack of resources and the Malagasy government is highly dependent on financial and technical support from donors (Ravaoarisoa et al., 2020 ) .
Failure to integrate local perspectives has also hampered ministry- level decisions on health- and agriculture- related policies. For example, a poor understanding of plague transmission, combined with the spread of misinformation through informal channels, contributed to an overall distrust of health authorities and further stigmatization of the plague during Madagascar's 2017 plague outbreak (Mattern et al., 2019; Ramaroson et al., 2019 ) . This resulted in widespread resistance to safeguarding measures (e.g. safe burials) and reluctance to seek medical help. In rodent pest control, social taboos can influence the local acceptability of control measures. For example, in some Malagasy communities, indigenous predators such as owls or snakes are associated with occult practices such as witchcraft (Constant et al., 2020 ) ; these communities may resist strategies that encourage these ‘taboo species’ as a means of rodent control.
In light of the above, there is a clear need to better understand the perspectives of different stakeholders towards rodents and their control; to identify appropriate rodent management goals and to facilitate the integration of multi- sectoral and multi- scale stakeholder interests within clearly defined decision- making processes. In this paper, we outline the framework for guiding the design, implementation, and evaluation of community- based interventions, taking rodent control in Madagascar as a model. Drawing on current literature and expert recommendations, we validate the framework through interviews and discussions with stakeholders and end- users following a structured and replicable process to identify relevant stakeholders existing at the national, regional, district and village levels. We then present the final framework before reflecting on its application within Madagascar's health and agriculture sectors, as well as its potential for addressing a broad range of complex social and ecological problems. | METHODS .1 | Designing the preliminary framework
To identify common factors linking successful community- based interventions, we conducted a literature review in Scopus using the search term: TITLE- ABS- KEY (Madagascar AND community AND (evaluat* OR assess*) AND (management OR intervention ) ) . Subject areas included agriculture, biological science, environmental K E Y W O R D S stakeholder engagement, community- based intervention, Madagascar, agriculture, rodent control, public health, management actions , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10438 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

SCOBIE et al. science, medicine, and social science. Results (n = 119) were manually screened based on titles and abstracts, retaining articles or reviews which evaluated the efficacy of community- based interventions in Madagascar (n = 16 ) .
The literature review had three objectives to identify: (1) common intervention approaches, (2) emergent concepts linking successful interventions and (3) existing frameworks. To extract the relevant information, we conducted a series of coding iterations. First, we identified the type of intervention and method of evaluation. We then extracted information on the strengths and weaknesses of each intervention and the lessons learned, as well as information from existing relevant frameworks (e.g. Raik & Decker, 2007 ) , to create a list of attributes (Appendix S1 ) . Similar attributes were grouped to create a smaller set of categories or themes around which a preliminary framework was constructed (Table 1 ) .
To supplement the literature review, we interviewed key informants representing researchers, technicians, and government officials from the agriculture, environment, and public health sectors ( n = 6 ) . Interviews were unstructured and any predetermined questions were open- ended. All factors identified as important in the design, implementation and evaluation of rodent- control programmes were, thus, included within the resulting preliminary framework presented in Table 1. .2 | Testing the preliminary framework
To test the assumptions of the preliminary framework and identify additional themes or concepts, stakeholder interviews and focus groups were conducted. Questions were designed around the framework and aimed to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of stakeholders with regards to rodent pests and their control. Data collection spanned the 2019– 2021 COVID- 19 pandemic; our methodologies were necessarily amended throughout, as detailed below. .2.1 | Ethics statement
This research was approved by the ethics committee of the Schools of Psychology and Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Aberdeen. We obtained the informed consent of each participant prior to their participation. The study objectives were explained to participants verbally and in writing, and participants were provided with the contact details of the lead researcher. In most cases, written consent was obtained; however, due to high levels of illiteracy amongst Madagascar's rural population, we also accepted verbal consent for participation in focus groups. In this case, only once both the facilitators and the partner organisation representative were confident that the participant understood the information was verbal consent accepted. .2.2 | Focus groups
Focus groups were conducted with farmers between November and February 2020. In light of the COVID- 19 pandemic, no focus groups were conducted after March 2020. Our objective was to test whether the assumptions of the preliminary framework represented the needs and perspectives of farmers and to explore, in broad terms, local attitudes towards rodent pests.
We conducted focus groups in two communes within the Haute Matsiatra, Vatovavy and Fitovinany regions (Figure 1 ) . Communes are the lowest administrative level with government representation ( below districts and regions) and are comprised of multiple villages. Within each commune, we conducted focus groups in 3– 5 villages. The two communes belonged to districts that had reported cases of bubonic plague during the 2017 plague outbreak, but no cases had been reported from the villages that we visited. So that participants felt able to give their opinions freely, focus groups were arranged and co- facilitated by representatives of local NGOs with strong existing ties with local communities. Site selection was therefore not random but depended on the presence of a partner organization willing to participate in the project.
Fourteen focus groups were conducted across eight villages, generating 5.5 hours of discussion with farmers on the topic of rodent pests. Eight focus groups were conducted with female participants, and six with male participants. Group size ranged from 5 to 11 participants (median = 8, total = 118 ) . Discussions lasted from 11 to minutes (median = 21 minutes ) .
Men and women over 18 years old were invited to participate. Malagasy society is traditionally patriarchal, and in a mixed male– female group the discourse will typically be led by men; therefore, focus groups were restricted to male- or female- only participants.
During focus groups, one moderator directed questions to the group whilst a second moderator took notes. Also present during focus groups was one representative from the partner organisation, Theme

SCOBIE et al. and the lead investigator (KS ) . Discussions began with a broad question on the types of agriculture practiced within the community, followed by a question on the challenges faced by farmers, and ended with a question on the participants' opinions on rats. The focus group schedule is provided in Appendix S2. .2.3 | Interviews
Semi- structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders representing the Malagasy government, academia, industry, and NGOs. Our objective was to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of these stakeholders with regards to rodent pests and their control. Interviews also provided an opportunity to identify the most important stakeholders and to map connections between them.
We initially identified stakeholders, defined as ‘any group or organization that could affect or is affected by rodent control in Madagascar’, through a review of the literature available on agriculture, rodent pest control and zoonotic disease in Madagascar and through consultation with experts (n = 7) from Madagascar's agriculture and health sectors. Interview participants were selected through key informant sampling (whereby interviewees were selected from the initial stakeholder list) and snowball sampling.
Prior to the COVID- 19 outbreak, interviews were conducted face- to- face. After March 2020, interviews were conducted by telephone. We stopped identifying new interviewees when no new themes were emerging in the data analysis (described below ) .
Interviews were arranged in four parts beginning with openended questions on the role of the interviewee and their organisation, followed by questions on the problems faced by rural Malagasy communities (see Appendix S3 ) . We then asked about rodent pest control in Madagascar and the key stakeholders involved. All questions were piloted with the survey team.
Interviews lasted 15– 120 min. Six interviews were conducted face- to- face and 14 by telephone. One interview was conducted in English (by KS) and the remainder (n = 19) in Malagasy (by MFR and RNR ) . We interviewed 26 stakeholders representing government ( n = 11) and NGOs (n = 15) within the public health (n = 10 ) , agriculture (n = 11) and environment (n = 3) sectors. Two NGO stakeholders represented both the public health and agriculture sectors. .3 | Analysis
Focus group discussions and interviews were audio- recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated from Malagasy to English. Transcripts were uploaded to NVivo 12 (QSR International Pty Ltd, 2020 ) . Responses were coded following the pre- selected pattern of the preliminary framework but with the flexibility to add codes as necessary. To check for consistency, a second member of the research team (JY) double- coded two of the transcripts.
The coded responses were reviewed to confirm the relevance of existing themes within the preliminary framework, identify areas of ambiguity or potential for misinterpretation, and identify any additional relevant themes not yet included. We then refined the framework based on these findings.
Finally, based on interviewee recommendations, we identified key stakeholders (i.e. those with the most influence on, or most influenced by, current or future rodent control programmes ) . Communication pathways linking key stakeholders were also incorporated into a stakeholder map (Figure S1 ) . The final map was validated by key informants representing the public health and agriculture sectors (n = 5 ) . | RESULTS
Below, we detail the findings which led to the final framework presented in Figure 2. Key themes are illustrated using verbatim quotes from the translated transcripts. Interview quotes are anonymised as follows: government (GOV ) , NGO— public health (PH ) , agriculture ( AG) environment (ENV ) — participant number.
Quotes from focus group discussions are coded as follows: HM ( commune Haute Matsiatra ) , VF (commune Vatovavy- Fitovinany ) — village number— M (men ) , F (women ) .

SCOBIE et al. same themes were identified by both groups and that perspectives given by men and women were consistent. .1 | People
Within the broader theme of People, interviewees highlighted the need to respect local culture: ‘taboos and customs of the place need always to be respected…you have to know the custom of a place before you do anything’ [NGO- AG- 3 ] . Another stakeholder connected culture with agricultural practices: ‘In [northern Madagascar ] , slashand- burn agriculture for maintaining cattle pasture is a cultural, social, political, everything issue’ [NGO- AG- 6 ] . Understanding culture was also suggested to improve communication: ‘If you don't have a relationship then people will just say ‘yeah, that's great’— but it doesn't mean anything. [In Malagasy] culture there's an element of non- confrontation’ [NGO- PH- 1 ] .
Communication was confirmed to be an important theme in discussions around rodent control. Communication of research findings was seen as necessary to inform government policy; for example, one stakeholder was responsible for delivering research recommendations from scientists to policymakers at the Ministry of Agriculture. Communication with end- users was also highlighted as necessary to inform policy makers of situations on- the- ground. For example, local community health centres are responsible for reporting plague cases to the central government via district and regional health authorities. Moving in the opposite direction, top- down communication was seen as necessary to notify local communities of government directives. One government stakeholder highlighted that, during the 2017 plague outbreak, instructions to reduce the spread of disease were sent from the central government to doctors in community health centres, who would disseminate information to local communities via community health workers (CHWs ) .
Two non- government stakeholders described how communication between end- users could facilitate behavioural change. For example, new agricultural techniques can be demonstrated on ‘model plots’; when farmers see the technique working well, they are encouraged to try it for themselves. This was echoed by farmers during focus group discussions.
Stakeholders from both the health and agriculture sectors identified human health as an important consideration within rodent control programmes. The primary concern relating to ill health was the impact on productivity and livelihoods: ‘The aim is to keep [people] healthy so that they are productive’ [NGO- AG- 1 ] . Access to healthcare was also an important concern: ‘We don't have enough doctors here— we have one doctor, but they don't take care of adults, just children’ [VF- 02- M ] .
Cooperation emerged as a new category within the broader theme of People. NGOs are required to cooperate with government agencies, for example, to obtain work permits or other authorisations. Cooperating with government agencies can also be perceived by local communities to provide NGOs with legitimacy: ‘ [ the government] have the authority to motivate and to initiate the programme FI G U R E 2 Framework focussed on the dimensions of People, Knowledge, Resources, and Power around which rodent management programmes can be designed and implemented. , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10438 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] . See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | People and Nature
SCOBIE et al. in general within the community, it's why cooperating with them is good in fulfilling an endeavour’ [NGO- PH- 3 ] . Cooperation across different sectors also allowed groups to benefit from each other's expertise: ‘Rodent eradication may have an ecological cost and so requires consultation with ecology experts’ [NGO- AG- 6 ] .
Different ministries were described as having a shared interest in rodent control and their cooperation was often perceived as fundamental. Several stakeholders criticised ministries for their failure to cooperate, with one non- government stakeholder accusing them of ‘passing responsibility to each other’ [NGO- ENV- 1 ] . Notably, a lack of cooperation between the public health and agriculture sectors is suggested by the absence of communication pathways linking these sectors in the final stakeholder map (Figure S1 ) . Additionally, two non- government stakeholders identified government instability as a barrier to effective cooperation.
Cooperation with local communities was also identified as important. Two stakeholders explained that participatory approaches were needed to identify issues, which are of concern to local people and to ensure that these issues are addressed appropriately. Cooperation with the local community was also perceived as allowing organisations to benefit from local knowledge, and could facilitate the eventual transfer of responsibility to end- users: ‘ [ local people] need to be taught, motivated and given all the necessary things to enable them to execute the work’ [NGO- PH- 3 ] . Finally, one stakeholder highlighted that rodent control required a collaborative effort by members of a community: ‘Rats won't disappear if the whole community does not combine their effort’ [NGO- ENV- 2 ] . .2 | Resources
Financial cost was confirmed by interviewees as an important consideration in rodent management interventions. For example, one stakeholder told us that the government had previously distributed rodenticides and trained farmers in their correct use but that this was scrapped in favour of cheaper rat traps. Several interviewees stated that interventions needed a long- term commitment: ‘ [ Programmes] become punctuated or temporary…but such effort should go uninterrupted’ [GOV- AG- 2 ] . Stakeholders, therefore, needed to consider the long- term implications of their programme: ‘If [the programme] was for a short- term, the rats would diminish for a while and then flourish again little by little’ [GOV- PH- 1 ] .
The resources available to the local population were another important consideration, which we found to be often overlooked. For instance, one government stakeholder described an initiative that taught farmers to fertilise their crops with cow manure, but which failed to account for the fact that the farmers did not own any cows. In the case of rodent control, communities can be reluctant to use rodenticides mixed with human food: ‘In places where they could afford it, they were willing, but in [other places] they were very reluctant in giving bait since they themselves don't have enough to eat’ [GOV AG 2 ] .
End- users may also lack the resources to cope with shocks to their livelihoods. This can create a barrier to agricultural change, as subsistence farmers may be opposed to changes that risk reducing their agricultural productivity (‘If they have a season where they don't grow enough, their kids don't eat’ [NGO- PH- 1] ) .
Several references were made to the land as a resource. In six of the focus group (two with men and four with women ) , participants spoke of having insufficient land on which to grow crops to feed and provide for their families. One stakeholder described a cycle of poverty whereby farmers borrow from wealthier neighbours but, without money to repay the loan, are later forced to give up their land, leading to tensions within the community: ‘so it happens that the little they have – such as rice fields – is taken from them’ [NGO- PH/
AG- 2 ] . .3 | Knowledge
In the preliminary framework, we included knowledge as an important concept within the broader theme of Resources. However, discussions with stakeholders and end- users indicated that the concept of knowledge was too complex to be considered under one heading. Therefore, in our final framework, we distinguish between ecological data, local ecological knowledge and education within the broader theme of Knowledge.
Four of the interviewees agreed that ecological data is needed to inform effective rodent management policies. Interviews and focus groups also highlighted the depth of local knowledge on rodents. During focus groups, participants described the different rodent species present as well as where they live, what they eat and what damage they cause, and shared information about different control methods (‘we often use pineapple leave and nothing else, not even [poison ] ’ [HM- 01- F] ) . Local ecological knowledge may also provide relevant insights into the interactions between rodent pests and other factors. For example, several farmers linked rodent movements with agricultural activities (‘when the crops come up, [ the rats] follow behind’ [HM- 02- M ] ) and with deforestation (‘when there is [slash- and- burn] then it's always the house rats that come’ [ VF- 01- M] ) .
Several stakeholders indicated that community- based interventions benefitted from a strong education component. This included practical education on how to implement specific technologies; for example, agricultural technicians can provide farmers with training in the use of improved farming techniques (e.g. the System of Rice Intensification) or developing alternative livelihoods (e.g. aquaculture, apiculture ) . In public health, large- scale educational campaigns can raise awareness of specific health issues (‘every year, during plague season, “health motivators” go around villages giving awareness talks’ [NGO- PH- 3] ) . Education also had long- term implications ( e.g. ‘there might be a pump project [to provide clean water ] , but what if the pump breaks? It's more about sensitization about the importance of clean water, or how you can clean water based on , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10438 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

SCOBIE et al. your situation’ [NGO- PH- 1] ) . Another stakeholder felt that education made people more receptive to new ideas: ‘if you open yourself up to education then you are open to new thought’ [NGO- AG- 4 ] . Conversely, several stakeholders indicated that low literacy levels could hinder behavioural change: ‘due to illiteracy it is very difficult to teach the farmers, it is difficult to convince them’ [GOV- AG- 2 ] . .4 | Power
Several stakeholders felt that the central government should be responsible for making and coordinating decisions about rodent control (‘ [ rodent control] will involve a large number of ministerial entities and so it is good for those at a higher level to coordinate it’ [NGO- PH- 2] ) . Another stakeholder emphasized the role of local government: ‘as soon as the district speaks, every commune, every village, every community, every household should obey since it's the voice of the parents, of the elders in the government, and the communities must somehow obey it’ [GOV- PH- 5 ] . Several stakeholders, however, described the conflicting advice previously given by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture regarding rodent control, and their failure to incorporate the needs of end- users. Specifically, whilst the Ministry of Agriculture promoted lethal rodent controls, an outbreak of plague led the Ministry of Health to forbid the killing of rats due to the potential risk of plague transmission. One stakeholder told us that, as a result, farmers outside of the plague zone suffered substantial crop losses whilst laws prevented them from using lethal rodent control.
Decentralisation of power was seen as potentially helpful to ensure that decisions were appropriate within the local social, environmental and economic context: ‘instructions come from down from the central level, but community agents know the situation in the villages and so people are taught according to the local situation and not theory parachuted from above’ [GOV- PH- 2 ] .
In addition, a number of stakeholders suggested that bottom- up approaches are useful in identifying locally- appropriate strategies: ‘the local community should be the first in charge because they see and interact with the rats’ [GOV- PH- 1 ] . However, inefficient communication pathways could lead to delays in action: ‘we sent a request to the ministry asking for any action to help us fight against the rats. Unfortunately, there was no response’ [GOV- PH- 3 ] .
Finally, discussions around power highlighted that those with influence were not necessarily the decision- makers and that those with power were not necessarily able to affect behavioural change. One non- government stakeholder described the frustration of working within the scope of programmes determined by international funders rather than according to the needs of the local community. Another stakeholder commented that programmes needed support from someone in local government to have influence within local communities: ‘you always look for someone who could collaborate with you, someone from the governing body who could help, otherwise people won't listen to you’ [NGO- PH- 2 ] . Importantly, authority figures were not necessarily those with the most power; for example, unofficial leaders (e.g. village elders) were often highly influential within their communities (‘the population work with obedience when the elders and tangalamena [traditional leaders] talk’ [GOV- PH- 5] ) . One stakeholder emphasized the role of women ( ‘when you can get buy- in from women I think that's a force to be reckoned with’ [NGO- PH- 1 ] ) whilst another emphasized the value of young people as ‘ambassadors of change’ [NGO- AG- 3] who— when empowered through education – could educate others within their community. | DISCUSSION
Rodent control is a complex socio- ecological problem, involving a network of stakeholders from across multiple sectors and hierarchies. Using qualitative data from stakeholder interviews and focus groups, we propose a framework centred around the dimensions of People, Resources, Knowledge and Power around which communitybased rodent management interventions can be designed and implemented. We believe that unifying stakeholder interests within the same framework could encourage and strengthen a multisector and participatory approach to tackling this and other complex social, economic and environmental issues. .1 | The People, Resources, Knowledge and Power framework
Communication and cooperation were identified as important considerations in rodent control programmes, which we group in the final framework within the broader theme of People. Developing interventions in collaboration with end- users can increase engagement and help to identify local needs (Cochrane et al., 2019; Douthwaite et al., 2002; Kuntosch & König, 2018; Rasolofoson et al., 2018; Singleton et al., 2004; Waeber et al., 2017 ) . Transparent communication with local authorities and communities can increase compliance (Ramanantsoa et al., 2017 ) , whilst communication between end- users can strengthen interventions and catalyse behavioural change (Asaaga et al., 2021; Barnes- Mauthe et al., 2015 ) .
Existing research has identified a need to support cooperation across Madagascar's different sectors and administrative levels, as well as improve communication between local authorities, researchers, and end- users (Cinner et al., 2009; Raik & Decker, 2007 ) . We note, however, that the transfer of information between stakeholders does not of itself guarantee the transformation of knowledge into action (Ferré et al., 2022 ) . Likewise, implementation through farmers’ groups is often said to enhance adoption but may nonetheless require additional support to create a substantial impact (Kuntosch & König, 2018 ) . One approach may be to increase support for extension services (i.e. communication and learning activities provided for rural communities by educators from the health and agriculture sectors ) . For example, Madagascar's network of CHWs provides a vital link between the formal health system and local communities, , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10438 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

SCOBIE et al. improving access to information and health services particularly in underserved areas. The CHW programme relies on foreign aid and is frequently hampered by interrupted or expired funding (Gilmartin & Saya, 2015 ) , but reliable funding to exploit this resource could enhance stakeholder communication, facilitate education and awareness raising, and engage and empower local communities.
An awareness of local values is needed to ensure that interventions are appropriate to local socio- cultural contexts and to help decision- makers identify potential barriers to change (e.g. Hume, 2009; Vallès et al., 2020 ) . Cultural factors can also be employed to increase compliance. For example, Westerman and Gardner (2013) used ancestral ceremonies as a novel approach to increase respect for marine protected areas. In the case of rodent pests, our research supports the view that management programmes are more effective if they are appropriate to the specific local context and designed in cooperation with end- users (Brown & Khamphoukeo, 2010; Makundi & Massawe, 2011; Palis et al., 2007, ; Singleton et al., 1999, 2004 ) .
The impact on human health is a fundamental consideration within rodent pest control. In particular, we found that many stakeholders were concerned about the impact of poor health on productivity (e.g. in terms of lost labour or earnings ) . This link could provide a useful tool for gaining buy- in from both local communities and institutional stakeholders for whom access to resources, or resource availability, was an additional important concern.
Alongside People, we include Resources as an important theme within the final framework. In community- based interventions, economic incentives can increase compliance (Aymoz et al., 2013; Waeber et al., 2017) and catalyse behavioural change (Long, 2017 ) . However, as we and others have found (e.g. McClanahan & Abunge, 2016; McClanahan et al., 2014; Rasolofoson et al., 2018 ) , unequal resource distribution and failure to meet expectations can undermine trust and risks disrupting social cohesion. Financial cost can also determine whether a site receives support at all; this can exacerbate geographic inequalities if more remote sites are deemed too difficult or costly to reach (e.g. Poudyal et al., 2016 ) .
The final framework also includes land tenure as an important consideration within the theme of Resources, though with additional implications for power dynamics. Without the security of land ownership, rural farmers are placed in a subordinate economic position. Land tenure security can strengthen individuals' economic and decision- making power (e.g. Allendorf, 2007; Asaaga et al., 2020; Widman, 2014; World Bank, 2008 ) .
Ultimately, decision- makers must consider whether interventions are economically feasible, considering both the financial costs as well as the time and labour requirements, and whether the resources are available to end- users (Constant et al., 2020; Moser & Barrett, 2003; Palis et al., 2003; Stoop et al., 2002 ) . Good quality rodent traps and poisons may be unaffordable or locally unavailable, whilst the clearing of fields or hedges requires additional labour (Belmain et al., 2018; Soarimalala et al., 2019 ) . Transparent cost– benefit analysis of interventions is recommended to manage expectations, increase compliance, and improve decision- making ( MacKinnon et al., 2018; McClanahan & Abunge, 2016; Swanepoel et al., 2017 ) .
To further support decision- making, it is widely accepted that designing effective rodent control programmes requires knowledge of both the target species' ecology and the local agricultural and ecological context (Singleton et al., 1999 ) . This data can be collected through rigorous scientific exploration, experimentation, and observation; however, our results also demonstrate that local ecological knowledge could be an important information resource. Whilst the accuracy of local ecological knowledge may be a limitation (e.g. Propper et al., 2020 ) , it nonetheless has the potential to supplement ecological data to develop site- specific interventions. In the final framework, we, therefore, distinguish between ecological data and local ecological knowledge within the broader theme of Knowledge.
Alongside these, we acknowledge the importance of education. By establishing a scientific foundation, educational components can build awareness and empower local communities to make informed decisions (Cochrane et al., 2019 ) . Additionally, contextualised learning enables local people to construct meaning based on their own experiences and can enhance the uptake of community- based interventions (Aymoz et al., 2013; Cochrane et al., 2019; Uphoff & Langholz, 1998; Waeber et al., 2017 ) .
Within the broader theme of Power, we include policy, decisionmaking, and influence as important considerations within rodent control programmes. In Madagascar, community- based interventions benefit from policies that respond to local needs (MacKinnon et al., 2018; Raik & Decker, 2007 ) . In rodent management, conflicting policies have created confusion and frustration amongst end- users and local authorities. Ministries from different sectors should therefore collaborate on developing unified policies which respect local values and protect the needs of end- users.
During the last two decades, Madagascar's government- wide move towards decentralisation has afforded greater decisionmaking power to regional and district- level authorities. However, local authorities often lack the capacity to enforce regulations and locally made decisions have weak links to those made higher up (Cinner et al., 2009; Dhital et al., 2015; Raik & Decker, 2007 ) . This can generate tension between central, regional and local government (Burnod et al., 2013) while a lack of transparency and high rates of corruption prevent decentralised agencies from functioning correctly (Holloway & Short, 2014; Raik & Decker, 2007 ) .
In line with existing research, we argue that greater involvement of diverse stakeholders and end- users in decision- making, together with structured and transparent decision- making approaches (e.g. documented approaches that follow a structured and evidencebased framework ) , could help to build trust, enhance compliance and ensure that decisions are locally appropriate. Additionally, local involvement in decision- making can strengthen interventions by increasing engagement and social cohesion (Barnes- Mauthe et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2019; Waeber et al., 2017 ) , whilst empowering community associations can contribute to more stable behavioural change (Sommerville et al., 2010 ) . Application of the multisector framework could support decision- making by providing , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10438 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

People and Nature
SCOBIE et al. a structure around which discussions are organised; for example, following a decision matrix approach, the framework could be used to determine the criteria on which different management approaches are evaluated. Whilst it is beyond the scope of our work to pinpoint appropriate rodent management activities, García- Díaz et al. (2022) recommend a procedure intended to facilitate multistakeholder collaboration when formulating priorities, targets and management actions related to invasive non- native species management.
Finally, seeking the support of those with influence was recommended to increase local support for community- based interventions. Whilst the direction of influence may be clear within social or political structures (e.g. a government hierarchy ) , an awareness of how complex social, historical, cultural and political conditions shape behaviours is also needed. Indeed, our results demonstrate that power and influence cannot be assumed to lie solely with the decision- makers or with those ‘at the top’. Instead, intervention programmes should identify individuals or groups who hold influence at the community level, including unelected leaders (e.g. village elders, see Westerman & Gardner, 2013 ) , young people and women. .2 | Application of the stakeholder map and framework
Initiatives aimed at developing rodent management have acknowledged the complex multi- level and multi- sectoral nature of the rodent pest problem (e.g. FAO, UNEP, WHO, and WOAH, 2022; WHO, 2019 ) . These aspects underlie the need for a framework that can strengthen and support cross- level and cross- sector collaboration. To help support such initiatives, the combined application of the stakeholder map and framework provides decision- makers with the tools for identifying key stakeholders and their relationships; understanding the varied needs and objectives of different stakeholders and ensuring that these are addressed within decision- making processes.
To ensure that the framework reflects the interests of all stakeholders, we used a structured and replicable process for identifying stakeholders. However, the stakeholder map is not exhaustive and should be adapted to reflect changes in the network over time and to identify any additional stakeholders within specific localities. For instance, local NGOs were not included in the stakeholder map but could play a valuable role in scaling- up rodent management programmes. We therefore recommend that future work investigates the role of local NGOs as important intermediaries between endusers and stakeholder groups operating at national or international levels. Additionally, whilst we consider our sample size to be adequate for framework analysis, a number of stakeholder groups were under- represented during interviews (e.g. international organisations, regional- level government stakeholders and those representing the environment sector ) . The framework should thus be adapted should additional themes emerge during future discussions around rodent control.
Application of the framework also requires an awareness of the connections between themes. In particular, the concept of Power is pervasive within the wider framework. For example, whilst rodent management actions may be determined under seemingly neutral conditions based on rodent ecology, in reality, those actions are implemented within complex and dynamic social, cultural and political conditions. Additionally, the imposition of rules or policy by external stakeholders can weaken existing and traditional management systems (Jones et al., 2008 ) . Informal social structures and local power relations may also complicate collaborative decision- making and contribute to the unequal distribution of resources, which risks increasing inequality within and between communities (e.g. Lammers et al., 2017 ) . Moreover, the participatory approach may, in itself, be an attempt to neutralize power asymmetries among stakeholders and foster more equitable governance (Apgar et al., 2017 ) .
Critical reflection of how power is exercised and its role in community- based rodent management programmes may provide insights that can be used to equalize power asymmetries (Raik et al., 2008 ) . This can be supported through application of the stakeholder map and framework, which provide structures around which decision- making processes (e.g. decision matrices, discrete choice experiments) can be designed. If a structured process is followed during decision- making, then exclusion of any of the stakeholders identified in the stakeholder map, or the omission of any of the themes identified in the framework, should be evident. Documenting decision- making processes will help provide transparency and make it possible to identify such absences (such as the exclusion of key stakeholders from decision- making) and question why they exist. .3 | Future research and practice directions
Rodent management programmes are confronted with the need to bring about a change in the behaviour of end- users (Makundi & Massawe, 2011 ) . We often encountered defeatist attitudes towards rodent pests— that rats are cunning, able to outsmart humans, and impossible to control. This can decrease farmers' motivation to participate in control activities (Belmain, 2010 ) . Programmes will therefore likely benefit from an adaptive management approach, whereby farmers and other stakeholders have flexibility to modify their management approach through interactive experiential learning ( Douthwaite et al., 2002 ) . For example, positive experiential learning and active involvement in decision- making was found to strengthen the motivation of farmers in Vietnam to participate in rodent management (Palis et al., 2011 ) .
Another concept which was raised during discussions, but which fell outside the scope of the framework, was the link between rodents and poverty. Globally, impoverished communities are disproportionately impacted by rodent pests (Bonwitt et al., 2017; de Klerk et al., 2016; Duplantier et al., 2005; Himsworth et al., 2013 ) . Malnutrition, poor sanitation, absence of schooling, insecurity, and inadequate health services were issues highlighted by our study participants. This is concerning of itself but may also have implications , 2023, 2, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10438 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [14/04/2023 ] .

SCOBIE et al. for the success of interventions which fail to address the underlying drivers of poverty. To manage expectations, researchers must be explicit with communities about the scope of interventions. Furthermore, in poor communities, even low external- input technologies may fall outside the reach of the poorest households (Moser & Barrett, 2003 ) . In our study, farmers without enough food to feed their families were unwilling to invest in rodent control, despite potential long- term benefits. This indicates a limitation of the framework but also raises the question of whether the framework can be used to help strengthen the systems to which it applies.
Finally, we hope that application of the framework will help to reduce conflicts, particularly through the collaborative development of interventions, increased transparency and enhanced communication between stakeholders. Nonetheless, stakeholders will require support in managing conflicts where they do arise. Whilst there is a growing literature on approaches to conflict resolution and management in invasive species management (e.g. Crowley et al., 2017; Estévez et al., 2014; García- Díaz et al., 2022 ) , research is needed to identify suitable approaches within the specific social and political context. For example, in light of complex power in- balances across Madagascar's social and political hierarchies, different decisionmaking approaches may be appropriate at different scales. | CONCLUSIONS
In Madagascar, rodent pest control represents a complex socioecological problem which different government and non- government organisations have so far struggled to address. In this study, we have organised key themes relevant to community- based interventions in a cohesive multisector framework, using a multi- method approach which draws upon current literature and is supported by discussions with key stakeholders. The resulting People, Resources, Knowledge and Power framework can be used to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of community- based interventions. By addressing the interests of all stakeholders, we hope that application of the framework will contribute to the development of effective and sustainable control strategies. Additionally, due to the inclusive and interdisciplinary nature of the framework, we believe that its potential applications are wide reaching and may help in addressing complex social, economic and environmental issues across scales, sectors and systems.

Abstract . Calling on the concept of environmental justice in its distributive, procedural and recognition dimensions, we implemented a coelaborative scenario building approach to explore sustainable livelihoods pathways in four sites belonging to two Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) in southern Africa. . Grounded on participation and transdisciplinarity, as a foundation for decolonised anticipatory action research, we aimed at stimulating knowledge exchange and providing insights on the future of local livelihoods engaging experts living within these TFCAs. . Our results show that wildlife and wildlife- related activities are not seen as the primary drivers of local livelihoods, despite the focus and investments of dominant stakeholders in these sectors. Instead, local governance and land use regulations emerged as key drivers in the four study sites.

BOURGEOIS et al. | INTRODUCTION
The western concept of nature conservation emerged in the late 19th century in the United States (Adams & Hutton, 2007; Cronon, 1996 ) . This movement was born in the midst of the colonial era and was rooted in a worldview in which Western patriarchal white societies felt they had the right to impose their values on the world, including the relationship between people and nature and between human populations. Despite the end of the colonial era in the second part of the 20th century, some colonial values still prevail in parts of societies and the conservation sector is no exception (Trisos et al., 2021 ) . In the 1990s, efforts to replace the dominant colonial conservation model of ‘fortress conservation’ by models in which local residents would be more involved in the governance of natural resources attempted to balance the power relationship between external and local stakeholders (Adams & Hulme, 2001 ) . However, the coloniality of conservation is enduring, particularly in Africa (Adams & Mulligan, 2002; Domínguez & Luoma, 2020; Garland, 2008 ) .
Local worldviews and knowledge and value systems still suffer the most from the domination of the western worldview in conservation, which results in their incapacity to thrive despite their relevance for local contexts. Externally imposed concepts and paradigms undermine concepts of social and environmental justice: who contributes to the governance of natural resources, how and who benefits from natural resources? How to ensure that local cultures and indigenous knowledge systems are respected and valued, that is, recognised (Honneth, 2016 ) ? How are conservation costs and benefits distributed? The need for the decolonisation of conservation is therefore linked to the tripartite typology of concerns of environmental justice: distribution, procedure and recognition (Martin et al., 2016 ) .
The recent history of conservation in southern Africa navigates around the concepts of decolonisation of conservation and environmental (in ) justice back and forth. In the region, many National Parks ( NPs) were designated during the colonial or apartheid eras, in areas merely unfit for any other forms of modern land use, albeit inhabited by indigenous communities (Andersson et al., 2014 ) . The creation of protected areas has been largely imposed on local communities, who were in many instances forcibly evicted from their land and alienated from meaningful access to all critical natural resources and culturally important sites (Adams & Hutton, 2007; Guerbois et al., 2013; West et al., 2006 ) . Colonial top- down governance and environmental injustice towards local residents of NPs prevailed.
Since the second half of the 20th century, globally, conservation models have exhibited several regime shifts, mainly influenced by evolving meanings and values of nature in western cultures ( Mace, 2015; Manfredo et al., 2016 ) . From the mid- 1980s on, the southern African conservation sector spearheaded innovative initiatives promoting the devolution of the management of natural resources at the periphery of protected areas to local communities ( Nelson et al., 2020 ) . In these Community- Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) programmes, the community- land or wildlife management areas are managed as a source of resources, harvested in the peripheral sink areas, which would also play a buffer role, reducing human/wildlife conflicts in adjacent agricultural areas ( Metcalfe, 1993 ) . The CBNRM programmes marked a significant global shift from ‘fortress conservation’ towards more inclusive approaches including ‘nature for people’ and ‘people and Nature’. This move further paved the way for a broader recognition of the interdependencies between protected and unprotected areas (Guerbois & Fritz, 2017 ) . This called to increased participation from all relevant stakeholders and led the way to the emergence of transdisciplinary approaches for protected area management (DeFries & Nagendra, 2017; Lang et al., 2012 ) . CBNRM programmes initially attempted to address environmental justice mainly through its distribution (e.g. benefits) and procedure (e.g. rights) components. In addition, this interdependence called for more systemic or holistic visions and a better recognition of the plurality of points of view expressed by actors with different weights within society and different representations (Guerbois et al., 2013 ) .
A sustained lobbying by conservation organisations triggered the establishment of Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) at the beginning of the 21st century (Ferreira, 2006; Hanks, 2003 ) . TFCAs, reconsideration. To date, the enduring coloniality of conservation prevents local citizens from truly participating in the planning and designing of the TFCAs they live in, leaving room for limited benefits to local citizens and often limiting Indigenous people's capacity to conserve. . A practical way forward is to consider environmental justice as a cement between the two pillars of the TFCA concept, that is, nature conservation and socioeconomic development of local or neighbouring communities, as part of a more broadly and urgent need to rethink the relationships between people in, and with, the rest of nature.

BOURGEOIS et al. which represent networks of protected areas and their surroundings, were largely preconceived by the organisations that originally funded them, together with central governments that operate them ( Baghai et al., 2018 ) . The concept of TFCAs seeks achieving balanced attention and actions on two complementary pillars, nature conservation and socio- economic development of local or neighbouring communities, as enshrined by the Southern African Development Community— SADC (Hanks, 2003 ) . Therefore, by design, the TFCA initiative takes into account the concept of environmental justice by positioning local residents of TFCAs as central actors. However, for the past 20 years, the focus on conservation has largely overshadowed the efforts to support TFCA residents (e.g. Lunstrum & Givá, 2020; Van Amerom & Büscher, 2005 ) . A net imbalance or disparity persists between the levels of investment in conservation (and tourism) and those in local development (e.g. Hübschle, 2017; Otsuki et al., 2017; Spierenburg et al., 2006 ) . Marginalisation of Indigenous people currently riddles TFCAs, leading to poverty, poor development, social injustice and inequity (Chatty & Colchester, 2002; Dzingirai et al., 2014 ) . The three pillars of environmental justice have been violated, intentionally or not, in a context of persistent neocolonial behaviour of some of the dominant actors of TFCAs.
First, local residents barely participate in the planning and design of TFCAs and actually know little about with their objectives ( Ferreira, 2006 ) . Since the CBNRM experiences, external stakeholders such as conservation organisations, states and private sectors have increasingly recentralised the control of conservation in communal areas (Cassidy, 2021; Kicheleri et al., 2021) and local communities, due to lack of appropriate decision- making rights, have behaved up to now, as reactive stakeholders, adapting to grasp what benefits are accessible to them. Second, private sectors and states capture most of the created wealth in an environment characterised by rentseeking behaviours (DeMotts & Hoon, 2012; Green et al., 2018; Kalvelage et al., 2022 ) . Benefits rarely reach local communities, who have to bear most of the conservation costs (Mbaiwa, 2005; Norton- Griffiths & Said, 2010 ) . This situation paves the way to hegemonic practices, exclusion, manipulation and limited benefits to local citizens (Bruna, 2019; Fairhead et al., 2012; Lunstrum, 2016; Witter, 2013 ) . Often the operation of protected areas has come in direct conflict with the basic needs of human development (Anderies et al., 2007; Cumming et al., 2014 ) . Finally, TFCAs entail an almost complete lack of recognition justice towards TFCA residents. The TFCA paradigm for conservation, imposed by the dominant Western worldview, has reduced the window for local communities to express their voice in what primarily deals with their future (Dressler & Büscher, 2008; Igoe et al., 2010; Wolmer, 2003 ) . The so- called ‘participatory approaches’ and programmes within TFCAs focus on the problems encountered by local communities as the result of situations that emerged due to inadequate initial consultations and recognition of interdependencies, knowledge systems and values. This reinforces gaps and mismatches (Büscher & Dressler, 2012; Dressler et al., 2010 ) .
This neocolonial approach has promoted a management based on developing wildlife tourism with little consideration for the potential of other services to the ‘Other’ people, especially neighbouring indigenous communities (Barrett, 2013; Ceausu et al., 2019; DeGeorges & Reilly, 2009; Dressler & Büscher, 2008 ) . This approach fuelled conservation- related conflicts, which include human– human conflicts around conservation, land use and human activities, wildlife poaching (Peterson et al., 2010; Redpath et al., 2015; Salerno et al., 2020 ) , human– wildlife conflicts, in particular their social dimensions (Dickman, 2010) and the conflicting recognition of indigenous knowledge and value systems in protected area management ( Lee, 2016 ) . For example, in the Hwange district of Zimbabwe, farmers living on the edge of protected areas have to sleep in their fields during the cropping season to protect their crops from elephant raids, each of them depending on a strong social cohesion at community level as they risk to lose their whole potential harvest in one single night (Guerbois et al., 2012 ) . These persisting mismatches derive from top- down initiatives forced upon local stakeholders to deal with the merely symptoms of their marginalisation instead of their root causes (Bechstedt, 2005; Rahnema, 1992 ) . This reduces not only the capacity of local stakeholders to have a chance to imagine their own future, but it also impedes them from participating proactively in present actions as they do not see room for manoeuvre beyond adapting to, or rejecting, the imposed future (i.e. being preactive at best if not merely reactive or passive ) .
Central to the notions of decolonising conservation and environmental justice is the need to promote a more balanced participation of the different stakeholders in TFCA, meaning greater participation of local communities in planning and management activities (Gatiso et al., 2022 ) . This also includes the aspect of public participation in research, determined by its degree and its quality (Shirk et al., 2012 ) . Public participation as the expression of a ‘just participation’ connects directly with the procedural dimension of environmental justice in conservation as the expression of a recognition process leading to redistribution of power (Ruano- Chamorro et al., 2022 ) . Participation aims to make visible the excluded local perspectives and knowledge (Hall & Tandon, 2017 ) . TFCAs should therefore look beyond a distributive model of justice to incorporate concerns for social recognition, including careful attention to ways to pursue equality of status for local TFCA stakeholders. This will require reflection on working practices and looking at forms of intercultural engagement that, for example, respect alternative ways of relating to nature and biodiversity.
Sustainability transformations in conservation are bound to irreducible complexity, deep uncertainties, a plurality of legitimate perspectives, value dissent, high stakes and sometimes decision urgency characteristic of a postnormal world (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993 ) . The ideals of scientific expertise or professional consultancy no longer fit in such a process, as it would lead to knowledge production processes prone to the risk of colonisation and the resurgence of environmental injustice. Irreducible complexity is associated with interconnected uncertainties that are inherent to complex social– ecological systems (Anderies et al., 2007 ) . The uncertainties stem not only from the known unknowns, but also the unknown unknowns that arise from human– nature interactions (human– nature , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10446 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] . See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | People and Nature
BOURGEOIS et al. connections ) , human– human interactions (institutional arrangements) and from the interaction of these interactions and their perception by different types of actors. The diversity of meanings and interpretations inevitably brings ambiguity, which requires a reformulation of the knowledge production processes employed, in terms of the types of knowledge used, how and by whom it is created, what values are incorporated, and how values are weighted (Brugnach & Ingram, 2012; Colloff et al., 2017 ) . Along those lines, Abson et al. (2017) identify three realms of deep leverages for sustainability transformation: restructure (i.e. change, stability and learning in institutions ) , reconnect (foster interactions between people and nature) and rethink (the way knowledge is produced and used ) .
To date, there is very limited published information about how local communities perceive their own futures in TFCAs (but see Chirozva et al., 2013; Chitakira et al., 2012 ) . There is an urgent need to repair and improve environmental justice and deconstruct the persistent neo- colonialism in TFCAs (Chan et al., 2020; Ferreira, 2006; Martin et al., 2016 ) . In this article, we argue that when facing a colonised past, a decolonisation of the present is required to prevent further colonisation of the future. For this reason, we posit our work as a participatory anticipatory action research for unveiling local visions and seeking recognition justice in the governance of interconnected conservation purposes and livelihoods promotion purposes. It is a means to promote a decolonial way of engaging with local stakeholders in the production of alternative futures (Bourgeois et al., 2022 ) . Through anticipatory participatory action research as a decolonial practice connected to justice, the exploration of possible futures is a citizen- centred approach that acknowledges the relevance of a plurality of perspectives leading to the acceptance of alternative futures. In this case, it renders justice by unveiling and honouring the perspectives of the communities whose futures are alienated by the implicit perceptions of the future the dominant stakeholders impose on them. Four principles, which are as many operational challenges, guided the way the research was conducted within the framework of the project (Bourgeois et al., 2022 ) . These are (i) negotiate the use of the future with local communities, (ii) recontextualise our practices, (iii) place local actors at the centre of the knowledge generation process so as to create a form of indigenousled transformative knowledge and (iv) embrace the concept of ‘servant leadership’ (Eva et al., 2019 ) . These principles were intended to apply in the practice of producing alternative futures a decoloniality of power as defined by Quijano (2000) and a decoloniality of knowledge (Hall & Tandon, 2017 ) . They will structure the discussion of the results of using an anticipatory participatory action research approach applied to complex social– ecological system, TFCAs in this case. | CASE STUDY AND METHODOLOGY .1 | Context of the study
This article reflects on the first steps of the implementation of the ProSuLi (Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods) project, implemented in four sites in two TFCAs in southern Africa (Figure 1) (Caron et al., 2022 ) . The primary objective of ProSuLi is to enhance adaptive comanagement of natural resources by local stakeholders ( mainly local communities) through participatory processes. The selection of sites was based on a collaboration between research institutions under a regional research platform (www.rp- pcp.org ) . Each partner selected a site in a region where it already had some activities implemented or wanted to do so. The Great Limpopo TFCA (GLTFCA) spanning almost 100,000 km2 resulted from an international treaty signed in 2002 by Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe (Peace Parks Foundation, 2020a ) . The Kavango– Zambezi TFCA (KAZA TFCA ) , resulting from a treaty signed in 2011, covers ,000 km2 in five countries (Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe) with an estimated population of over 2 million people living on both communal lands and urban centres (Peace Parks Foundation, 2020b ) . All sites have a semi- arid climate and harbour healthy wildlife populations, high large mammal densities in a mostly unfenced environment. Local livelihoods rely mainly on subsistence agriculture, including extensive small- scale farming and remittances from family members working in urban centres or mines in South Africa. Local project coordinators determined the spatial limits at each site in agreement with local authorities, considering the level of resources available for the project and spatial equity. In Zimbabwe, to scale dependencies in natural resource governance, they choose to work on relatively small scales (ward level ) , reaching out to populations ranging between 5000 and 10,000 people at each site (Table 1 ) . .2 | The Futures workshops
We adapted and used a coelaborative scenario building approach called participatory prospective analysis (PPA) (Bourgeois, Liswanti, et al., 2017 ) , as a human- centred forward- thinking activity rooted in participation and transdisciplinarity (Gudowsky & Peissl, 2016 ) , to explore alternative futures for local livelihoods and associated issues at stake. This methodology is used to implement anticipatory processes in complex multistakeholder environments dealing with wicked problems world- wide (Bourgeois, Liswanti, et al., 2017; Bourgeois, Penunia, et al., 2017; Shantiko et al., 2021) and in Africa (Camara et al., 2019; Puskur et al., 2017; Sourisseau et al., 2017 ) .
Considering that ‘All efforts to ‘know the future’ in the sense of thinking about and ‘using- the- future’ are forms of anticipation’ (Miller, 2018, p. 52 ) , it seeks to improve the conscious use of the future in the present (Rossel, 2010 ) . It gives the possibility to use the future to make sense of, and to sense novelty in the present (Miller, 2015, ; Rhisiart et al., 2015; Slaughter, 2012 ) . Using the future is thus a transitional step that allows participants to explore pathways beyond the current trends (see Johansson, 2021 for a critical review on scenario building ) . We implemented it through three decolonising postulates: (i) the future does not exist in the present, only representations of the future, (ii) there is no truth about the future since there are no facts about the future and (iii) the future is a mental and , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10446 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

In each site, we started with an agreement about the issue at stake and its related dimensions- geographic boundaries, time horizon and group of actors, (the where, when, who ) . A collective identification and definition of factors of change followed (including social, technical, environmental, economic and political dimensions ) . The factors of change are the constitutive elements of the evolution of the system, in the past, the present and the future.

BOURGEOIS et al. ( Saritas & Smith, 2011 ) . Participants identify internal and external factors, respectively, being factors that actors in the system control and those they cannot control or influence (Bruaset & Sægrov, 2018; Crawfords, 2019 ) . Focusing on internal factors is crucial for enabling local agency (Bourgeois, Liswanti, et al., 2017 ) . Then the participants collectively selected the most influential internal factors of change, also called driving forces or drivers (Saritas & Smith, 2011 ) , through a structural analysis (Godet, 1986 ) . These drivers play a structuring role in the system. Through collective brainstorming, contrasted and mutually exclusive hypotheses are made about alternative future states of each driver at the selected time horizon (steps 1– 3 in Figure 2 ) . For this step, we invited the participants to think about desirable and undesirable states, current trends (likely trajectory) or ruptures. In this paper, we focus on presenting the comparative results of steps 1– 3 at our four study sites. Steps 4– 8 are indicated here as a matter of interest but will be presented and discussed in another article. .3 | Participation, facilitation and decision rules
The Futures workshops took place between October 2018 and March 2019 and lasted each a total of 3 days. Preparatory work included the identification and invitation of 20– 35 local resource people, including district officials. They were individuals selected for their knowledge and experience about local livelihoods, their ability to consider different perspectives, and tolerance of other opinions. The domains of expertise of the participants are displayed in Supp. Mat. 1. We seek balance in terms of age, gender and social categories. The identification of these resource persons took place after several months of preparation with local stakeholders and partners ( Botswana, Mozambique) or through knowledge and experience gained from more than 10 years of local engagement in Zimbabwe. Local authorities granted authorisations to conduct workshops through prior meetings and/or official letters to their representatives and/or existing memorandum of understanding (e.g. in Zimbabwe between district authority and research bodies ) . All participants gave their prior oral consent to participate in the workshops. Oral consent was chosen because many of them could not read and this is the method usually used and suggested by local authorities. All activities took place in English or Portuguese (Mozambique) and vernacular languages, Setswana, Shangaan, Shona, Nambya or Ndebele, depending on the location. Participants were free to use their preferred language and we ensured that they had also access to informal translation.

BOURGEOIS et al.
In order to move forward through the different steps of the workshops, we started by asking the participants to establish the house and decision- making rules that they would use when there was no immediate agreement on a specific question. They generally opted for a process of (i) listening to different perspectives and discussing them, (ii) checking them whether this would make it possible to reach an agreement and (iii) if not, reframing the issue until people could ‘live with it’. This processed proved sufficient for addressing potential dissent, since we made clear that in the construction of scenarios there was no absolute truth, no ‘right’ and no ‘wrong’. In Hwange (Zimbabwe ) , when consensus was not reached, the participants decided to use vote and defined 66% voices as the majority. If 66% was not achieved, then 51% was the majority for the second vote. In order to grant space for true participation, the workshops alternated individual, group and plenary activities. We also adjusted according to local specificities such as in Mozambique, where using visuals, symbols, colours as well as ‘personification’ of concepts facilitated the participation of several nonliterate people. In Botswana, due to a large number of participants, the latter occasionally requested to work in groups organised per village.
All sites had a very similar agenda (Supp. Mat. 2 ) , although the implementation of the Futures Workshops had to be adapted due to contrasted local contexts and history of engagement, which imposed some adjustments of the methodology. An adjustment needed to face time constraints was the preparation of a preliminary list of factors of change, collated through a review of previous research conducted in each location. Through in- depth group and plenary discussions, the participants systematically revised and amended the list. Another adjustment was transforming the structural analysis into more intuitive, yet structured, locally adapted approaches, so as to balance tradeoffs between the quality of the results and time constraints (Supp. Mat. 3 ) . In all sites, participants performed a collective mapping process to determine the influence between factors of a given category. After displaying the collective results, they voted for the five most influential drivers ensuring the representation of at least three of the five dimensions (social, technical, economic, environmental and political ) . Then the participants collectively selected five drivers from a minimum of four of these dimensions to ensure the possibility to create alternative scenarios that encompass several dimensions. For this article, the outputs of the workshops were screened for conceptual content analysis to uncover salient and recurrent elements resulting from the participatory processes. | RESULTS .1 | The issue at stake
The orientation of the ProSuLi project predetermined the issue at stake— Promoting sustainable livelihoods in TFCAs— inspired by several years of engagement in three of the sites. The question at the core of the Futures workshop was labelled as follows: ‘What could be the futures of livelihoods in [the selected sites, respectively ] ?’ The time horizon selected by the participants was 2036 in Botswana corresponding to the Botswana Vision 2036 (Vision 2036 Coordinating Agency, 2019 ) . For Zimbabwe, they selected 2038 in Chiredzi and in Hwange. In Mozambique, the selected time horizon was 2040. They are consistent with usual recommendations and empirical practice (Börjeson et al., 2006; Boschetti et al., 2016 ) , which suggests that participants had a good grasp of the purpose of the whole process. .2 | Factors of change
In total 105 factors of change were identified: 36 in the Eastern Panhandle, 34 in Hwange, 36 in Chiredzi and 30 in Moamba. Most factors related to social and environmental dimensions (respectively, accounting for 39% and 21% of the enumerated factors ) , followed by economic (16% ) , politics, governance (13%) and technical (10%) ( Figure 3a ) . Table 2 provides a summary of the factors of change per category, as provided by the participants in different areas. The full list of factors and their definitions can be found in Supp. Mat. 4. .3 | Drivers of change
In each site, the participants collectively identified five drivers of change from the set of 30 to 40 factors previously defined (Figure 3b,c ) . We witnessed evidence of growing ownership of the process during FI G U R E 3 Results of the structural analysis in the three sites.

BOURGEOIS et al. discussions about the relative influence between factors in the structural analysis. This collective process allowed participants to sense and share the plurality of understanding of the systems dynamics. The discussions sometimes led to the reformulation or combination of certain factors, but in all cases, the participants collectively reformulated the definition of each of these drivers (see Supp. Mat. 4 and for more details ) . In Eastern Panhandle, the participants merged the state of land use regulation and the related land use allocation factors as one. Similarly, they defined the driver Human/wildlife interaction management as the management of risk related to the elephant population in relation to human injury and crop damage, combined with the management of risk with respect to predator/livestock conflicts and other human– wildlife interactions. In Hwange, participants requested a restructuration of some drivers: they created Governance and community combining Local governance and Community organisation; Land use regulation and allocation combining Land use regulation and Land use allocation; and Farming systems and Livestock management combining Farming systems and Livestock management. In Chiredzi, after seeing the results, participants preferred to select Governance capacity of the local community rather than land use allocation, as a driving force and decided to include a specific land use allocation dimension in the description of the future states of this driver. They also merged types of farming and livestock systems. In Moamba, because votes and opinions pointed to equally influential factors, participants decided to group food security with family farming as a single selected driver.
The structural analysis made the political dimensions the main drivers, while the economic dimensions were cited as drivers only in two sites (Figure 3b ) . As shown in Table 3, we identified some striking convergences and a few disparities in the drivers at the different sites. Local governance and land use regulation, grouped in a Governance and Land Use Planning cluster, were perceived across the four sites as two of the main drivers of sustainable livelihoods in TFCA (6/20 drivers ) . The third cluster (4/20) referred to Farming systems cited as drivers at all sites except the Eastern Panhandle. Natural resources (state and management) (3/20) and Culture and education (3/20) clusters came next and almost similarly at the four study sites. Economic development (2/40) and Services and Infrastructures (1/40) were perceived as a key driver in two communities, in the Eastern Panhandle and in Chiredzi, respectively, in relation to job opportunities and the state of poverty. .4 | Future states of drivers
In each site, the participants reflected in small groups on potential future states of the different drivers also known as the morphological analysis (Table 4 and Supp. Mat. 6 ) .

BOURGEOIS et al. room for creative thinking and helps them go beyond conventional thoughts based on the extrapolation of trends (desirable or undesirable, and ruptures ) . | DISCUSSION
Futures workshops were organised at four sites in three countries in two TFCAs as a first step of a development project to enable local stakeholders to use the future to codesign activities focusing on promoting their livelihoods (Caron et al., 2022 ) . Capturing the views local stakeholders expressed through the Futures workshops allowed us to test an anticipatory participatory action research methodology as a process contributing to promote a decolonial approach to the future of local communities. We observed mismatches between worldviews of local and external stakeholders, including a lack of recognition of local cultures and knowledge, preventing local stakeholders to play an active role in the framing of their own livelihoods. The views expressed by local stakeholders call for more engagement towards environmental justice in the implementation of TCFAs. After these points of discussion, we then explore the few convergences and many discrepancies between global and local TFCA framing and discuss the implications of this mismatch of expectations. Finally, we discuss the possible coloniality associated with this study and clarify to what extent the results, that is, factors of changes, drivers and their future states come from a rather decolonial process. .1 | Mismatches between worldviews
We observed substantial consistency and similarity in the drivers of change and their different states across the four study sites. Therefore, we infer that these are robust constitutive elements of the perception that local people have of the future of their livelihoods TA B LE 4 Synthesis of the results of the morphological analysis on the most common drivers of sustainable livelihoods in the four study areas

BOURGEOIS et al. in TFCAs. This consistency encourages us to expose how local people consider the future of their livelihoods in the context of TFCAs. Most drivers are absent from the discourses and practices applied to TFCAs. This is particularly true for local and broad- scale governance, land use and corruption, the integrity of natural resources that are not wildlife (soil and minerals, energy, water, woodland, grassland ) , public infrastructures (education, health, transport ) , social changes including valuing local cultures.
Dominant external stakeholders have crafted TFCAs as large African landscapes, where nature conservation and local development and well- being are expected to coexist and interact positively with each other (Hanks, 2003 ) . The assumption is that more conservation areas, themselves more connected through wildlife corridors enabling wildlife mobility across countries, could boost a wildlifebased economy. As a result, through a trickle- down process, the livelihoods of people in TFCAs would be linked to conservation through employment and multiple revenues, so that people would become the first custodians of protected areas and TFCAs, protecting them against harmful external behaviours such as poaching activities ( Stoldt et al., 2020 ) . The participation of local communities in conservation programmes is supported to improve the legitimacy and appropriation of conservation areas, as well as the engagement of the community in conservation. Many of these models now acknowledge the importance of incorporating some benefit redistribution in an explicit manner, such as sharing tourism revenue, compensation for wildlife damages or alternative livelihoods to minimise income activities conflicting with conservation objectives (Mannigel, 2008 ) . However, the distributive component of environmental justice, if necessary, is not sufficient. Framing local livelihoods only through the prism of conservation and imposing livelihood activities bound to conservation (e.g. tourism, antipoaching) without attempting to understand the will of the people violates the procedural and recognition components of environmental justice (Martin et al., 2016 ) .
Local worldviews are anchored in African cultures, value systems, and livelihood logics where small- scale agriculture, including rainfed and irrigated crops and extensive livestock production, is the main pillar. These worldviews are similar to those of societies of semi- arid areas of western Africa, not included in TFCAs nor close to a protected area, and are not integrated into the TFCA design. In theory, a future where both the conservation and agricultural sectors coexist sustainably is possible but an alternative one without agriculture or without conservation would compromise the well- being of stakeholders (e.g. Keesing et al., 2018; Tyrrell et al., 2017 ) . Guerbois and Fritz (2017) show in Hwange the critical role protected areas play in buffering natural resource crises in communal areas. The impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on the finance of the conservation sector in southern Africa has also shown the limitation of a conservation model funded exclusively through tourism (e.g. Smith et al., 2021 ) . More balanced or integrated investments in conservation and local livelihoods with processes rooted in the current reality of the TFCAs would help overcome the gap in these different perceptions and decolonise the initial process of the TFCAs.
The worldviews about governance systems diverged fundamentally. External stakeholders from the conservation sector draw lines on maps, (re ) connecting protected areas to promote wildlife mobility and ecological function, only later engaging local stakeholders to deal with the consequences of these desktop decisions. The precedence of the conservation dimension over the social dimension creates a major mismatch between local and external actors. Local stakeholders during Futures workshops expressed the feeling of being left behind in decision- making about their life, a feeling of being powerless to take charge of their own livelihoods. They did not mention TFCA conservation stakeholders in their discourse, but the local governance system, which is largely top- down with little participation and inclusivity. The centralised governance issue was pregnant in local livelihood discourses with important impacts on land use and access, especially in terms of land allocation, but also on natural resource access (e.g. water, soil for agriculture, pasture ) . The willingness of local communities to take charge of their destiny and to assume their own internal and external governance contrasted with the absence of their role in decision- making in the conservation worldview. Beyond the issue of environmental justice, this is a major violation of key principles in sustainability theories such as inclusivity, equity and conflict resolution mechanisms (Chan et al., 2020; Ostrom, 2009 ) .
The place of local culture and value systems in local livelihoods was expressed as another pillar of local worldviews that deserved to be protected from outside influence. Indeed, they do not reject what outside influence could bring, for example, education, health, roads and communication, but are concerned with their capacity to ensure that these will not continue to destroy ultimately what they value most in their culture. This position contrasts with the highly technical worldview of conservation, which attempts to import economically oriented innovations without considering the effects on local culture. It is a remnant of colonial times, when a completely exogenous worldview was forced on African cultures across the continent that persists today and still ignores local worldviews and their relevance and importance for local livelihoods. Local stakeholders fear that whenever an external innovation is imposed on them, it will erode their culture. Therefore, there is no easy permeability of local livelihoods to innovations, in addition, when these innovations target an entirely new sector such as tourism. This aspect is never taken into account when external projects bring technical innovations (e.g. in agriculture ) . This is not to say that local culture should be protected at all costs. Modern social concepts, such as gender equity, can challenge aspects of local culture. This means that it is a crucial dimension that must be seriously included for the effective design of more integrated investments in local livelihoods and conservation mentioned above. This includes processes that make it possible to anticipate possible positive and negative impacts in a systemic way that external and local stakeholders must discuss in order to negotiate the conditions and context of these investments. This point is clearly a call for more recognition of local culture and knowledge systems (i.e. the third component of environmental justice ) . , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10446 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

BOURGEOIS et al. .2 | A call for environmental justice in TFCAs
The presence of a protected area in the local landscape did not play a significant role in the expressed futures, with the exception of the relationship between humans and wildlife that was mentioned at a single site (Eastern Panhandle, Botswana) and strictly concerned the management of negative interactions such as human/elephant and /lion conflicts. This is a noteworthy point for sites belonging to TFCAs. Contrary to our expectations, local communities do not see wildlife primarily as a natural resource on which they would depend but as part of the nature they also belong to. Similarly, but for Eastern Panhandle, wildlife- related activities are not considered the pillar of economic and social structure at all. However, the regulation of natural resource use (which traditionally existed in the forms of taboos and sacred areas before colonialism but have been replaced by state rules and centralised power) appeared critical to achieve sustainable livelihoods and to maintain indigenous culture, knowledge and value systems. This means that in order to connect nature conservation with sustainable local livelihoods there is a need for a kind of inside- out conservation process (Western et al., 2020) based on local communities practices and visions as a way to foster recognition through appropriate procedural arrangements.
Farming systems, both crop and livestock, which remain the pillars of the economic and social structure of these communities and rely on indigenous knowledge systems, face the risk of change and disappearance through external and global forces and changes. A continuous heavy dependence on the state of natural resources provides the basis for agricultural and livestock activities, namely water, soil, energy, material and forage, as well as nontimber products for food and medicine. These local knowledge and practices are rooted in culture and traditions, which used to define the relationships and solidarity between all elements of the system (human and nonhuman ) . However, degraded lands and a lack of infrastructure characterise the landscapes of the so- called ‘marginalised’ communities. If ecological research at the interface of protected areas and communal land has shown that manipulating resources, land use and practices can improve human– wildlife coexistence (Guerbois et al., 2012; Valls- Fox et al., 2018 ) , this seems to remain highly contentious from a private operator perspective, as ‘tourists don't travel to southern Africa to see people and cattle’. This vision reflects Eurocentric individualist value systems where lands and cultures are commodified instead of being treated as Commons (Büscher & Dressler, 2012 ) . The marginalisation process, which started centuries ago, has led local communities into poverty traps due to the loss of opportunities to nurture the ‘original’ value system, discredit brought to systems of indigenous beliefs through religion and the decomposition of traditional leadership suffocated by administrative centralised institutions (Guerbois et al., 2013 ) .
Governance structures and relationships within the community and between the community and the local government and other stakeholders are critical in this changing environment to frame the future, especially regarding land use and regulation. This convergence of local governance and land use regulation in all four sites indicates that our results support the social– ecological system framework principles of decision- making rights and ownership as a key general principle determining sustainable management of natural resources (Dawson et al., 2021; Ostrom, 2009 ) . Indeed, all the groups expressed the idea of more decentralised and transparent decision- making processes that focus on local needs. This is not only about past colonial practices, but also about the lack of trust in the way decisions regarding land and resource allocation are being made today in these areas, including at the local government level. The participants talked about proactive, participatory and inclusive ( in gender and age) community governance systems, where leaders would lead by example, based on local cultures and ‘original’ value systems. The idea of living ‘unified in diversity’ echoes the philosophy of Ubuntu anchored in the ethical principle of promoting life through mutual care and sharing between and among humans and nonhumans (Mabele et al., 2022 ) . It advocates for diversification and holism, the integration of multiple land uses, including tourism and farming. Abundance is the goal and translates in the management of domesticated and nondomesticated resources, including wildlife, water, farmed and natural resources, based on well- informed land use planning for the sustainability of a plurality of values and multiple uses, and allocated through professionalism and efficiency. This local vision captures the three fundamental components of environmental justice: procedural, distributive and recognition (Martin et al., 2016 ) .
Whereas our findings point to the needs of considering environmental justice as a prerequisite for decision- making in protected areas centred socio- ecosystems, it also broadly resonates with the recent proposed concept of convivial conservation, that is, a postcapitalist approach to conservation that promotes radical equity, structural transformation and environmental justice and so contributes to an overarching movement to create a more equal and sustainable world (Büscher & Fletcher, 2019 ) . .3 | External perspectives, local realities: Mind the gap
If external perspectives continue shaping the future of TFCAs, these will colonise the perspectives hold by local actors whose voices will remain barely heard or taken into consideration, and TFCAs will not achieve their genuine purpose (Chan et al., 2020; Ostrom, 2009 ) . We argue that imposing these visions reduces not only the capacity of local stakeholders to imagine their own future in that coexistence process, but it also impedes them to engage proactively in present actions as they do not see rooms of manoeuvre beyond adapting to, or rejecting, the imposed future (i.e. being reactive at best if not merely passive ) .
We believe that engaging all stakeholders (i.e. external and local) in anticipation processes such as the Futures workshops presented here has potential to start addressing the mismatch of expectations created by previous externally imposed and top- down approaches in conservation. The current way of doing local development is not , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10446 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

BOURGEOIS et al. particular to the stakeholders of TFCA and applies to many sectors of development in developing countries and is anchored in the historical relationship between societies of dominant empires and colonised territories (Bourgeois et al., 2022; Dressler & Büscher, 2008 ) . This type of behaviour that reproduces past relationships between dominant and dominated stakeholders (e.g. colonial power— African black populations, dominant state— ethnic minorities) means that local stakeholders have developed response strategies such as passive acceptance of whatever comes in terms of infrastructure, training and innovation from a project even if it has no chance of surviving the project's lifetime. When presenting the ProSuLi project to local stakeholders at the Mangalane site in Mozambique, local stakeholders asked, ‘What do you bring to us?’. We answered this question by ‘you will decide what the project will bring to you’. This created a misunderstanding of the project objectives and it took time for the project team to get the trust and collaboration of local stakeholders into such a not- business- as- usual approach. Therefore, an approach that encompasses anticipation and other participatory approaches will need to trigger behavioural changes not only in external but also in local stakeholders.
Using the Futures to impact the present therefore requires changes in mindsets and behaviours of all stakeholders, not only dominant and local stakeholders but also researchers, local governmental services, local NGOs and donors, and turn the whole process into a type of participatory anticipatory action research that is truly decolonial (Bourgeois et al., 2022 ) . Concretely, this means that the way projects are framed, designed and implemented both financially and in time needs to change. Using Futures to codesign the present means that projects cannot have activities starting in the first months of the project and that a certain amount of time and means need to be directed in implementing these approaches, ideally during an inception phase whose length needs to be carefully negotiated with stakeholders and the donor. Of course, such approaches require specific skills such as facilitation, and capability such as futures literacy (Miller, 2007) and experience (e.g. local knowledge) without which they could miss their objectives and even be counterproductive. This mixture of skills ensures that local level of perceptions and decision is from the beginning embarked into the project design, bridging the governance gap highlighted here.
The capacity acquired by local people through the process of reflecting on their present situation and acting accordingly as opposed to getting people to react to imposed visions of the future, is probably the main output of this process. It promotes the creation of a space and time for multistakeholder thinking about the future of the area and the condition of its local stakeholders. This process may seem as a luxury not only when the realities of poverty keep on diverting oneself from any form of projection beyond a few days horizon, but also forbidden by standard conservation and development strategies. Yet, this is a necessity, as while one cannot predict the future, it will happen anyway, and depriving anyone from the possibility to use it only ends up in being unable to make the difference that will count for themselves or the next generations. .4 | Testing the approach as a Decolonial practice
We use here the four principles proposed by Bourgeois et al. (2022) to discuss to what extent this methodology contributed to a decolonial practice of anticipation. .4.1 | A negotiated process of cooperative design involving all actors
The implementation of Futures workshops was based fundamentally on the participation of local resource persons. However, the remoteness of the study sites made it difficult to develop intensive and iterative interactions prior to the Futures Workshops. Local understanding that participants were resource people, in the sense of knowledge bearers, and not mandated representatives of different groups of interest was of particular importance. We were able to ensure such a distinction, thanks to the local coordinators from the local communities supporting the project, who helped identify participants to ensure a diversity of perspectives based on experience, origin, gender, age and social status.
We had to take into consideration the question of influence and power relations during the implementation of the workshops. The selection of participants as knowledge bearers and the facilitation process, which relied on techniques enabling everyone to express their views and their ideas without knowing who suggested them, partially addressed this. We ensured that all had the opportunity to speak or intervene in the process, working simultaneously in different languages and/or using symbolic ‘language’ (e.g. drawings of items such as people, animals, houses on signs to represent some factors) to increase understanding and participation of less literate people.
The availability of the participants who could not all allocate days for a full Futures Workshop led us to negotiate the reduction of the whole process from 5 to 3 days. In response, we prepared a preliminary list of factors of change that helped also preventing a common caveat, which is the weight of the past and the urgency of the present determining the way people think about the future. .4.2 | Recontextualising our research
The implementation of the methodology in different contexts led us to contextualise it accordingly as its purpose was not to produce knowledge per se as the result of a standard approach but to engender a reflexive process in our own practice based on moral discernment. Transforming the full structural analysis resulted from the realisation that it involved a way of thinking and tools that could have excluded many of the participants. In each site, the process of selecting the drivers from the factors of change, as detailed in Supp. Mat. 4, was the result of an ad hoc discussion with the participants once they understood what the purpose was. The process of selecting the drivers was ultimately less rigorous than what we had planned, but the interaction between participants during this , 0, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10446 by Inrae - Dipso, Wiley Online Library on [01/03/2023 ] .

BOURGEOIS et al. process indicated that it was an important phase of appropriation of the methodology and the objectives. The consistency of the results ( Table 3) tends to advocate for their robustness, given that we developed different adaptive measures at each site. .4.3 | Creating indigenous- led transformative knowledge with local actors at the forefront of the inquiry
Being aware that in action research any activity with an exogenous component, such as the preliminary lists of factors of change, can limit the expression of indigenous- led knowledge, we took special care ensuring deep and careful discussions of these lists and modification through group works, collective discussion and transparent changes. Creating spaces of intercultural interpretation helped to negotiate and adapt meanings. The participation of different perspectives also changed individual perspectives, including ours, and reduced the gaps between them. The factors of change, drivers, and most of all the future states constitute thus an indigenous- led knowledge based on their own perceptions of the future, which the Futures Workshop helped to unveil. Actually, neither the workshop facilitators nor the local coordinators had any idea of the content that would come out of the Futures workshops. Furthermore, the focus on internal factors produced not only indigenous- led knowledge, but also potentially transformative knowledge. The members of the ProSuLi project reported that this knowledge coproduction opportunity legitimised new ways of engaging in the subsequent phases of the project, providing an entry point for marginalised voices. The latter was witnessed by further actions following the Futures Workshop, which are not discussed here, but can be found elsewhere (Caron et al., 2022 ) . .4.4 | Embracing the framework of servant leadership
As facilitators, we had to take leadership in the implementation of the workshops. The framework of servant leadership (Greenleaf, 1998) guided us, so that our engagement in, and the design of the Futures workshop was based on our belief that the future is a public good ( Bourgeois et al., 2022 ) . As such, it is a resource that everyone has the right to use in their own ways, provided that they are aware of the different ways of using it. However, this research faced an inescapable tension between the exogeneity of the project as an external initiative mostly implemented by external researchers and the willingness to support endogenous transformative changes. Therefore, we had to approach local actors at the different sites with an honest posture regarding what we offered to do, even if the concepts themselves were rather exogenous. Still, the fundamental orientation of the project itself provided a much- needed opportunity to engage local actors in framing their own futures, if not by codesigning the whole process but at least through their direct involvement in the production of the results. | CONCLUSIONS
TFCAs provide a unique opportunity to produce healthy landscapes with a sustainable coexistence between people and nature but seriously need approaches that are designed and implemented along the lines of a decolonial process to address the environmental injustice prevalent in the residents of TFCA.
Through a comparative and people- centred anticipatory approach focusing on the perceptions of local communities and other stakeholders in four different sites, we unveiled the drivers of change for the futures of local livelihoods alongside conservation areas. We highlighted a significant gap between the global discourses on improved livelihoods and poverty reduction through tourism- based income- generating activities and local aspirations. The drivers of local livelihoods were largely shared between the four sites, identifying governance issues at various levels, the reliance of local communities on natural resources for small- scale agriculture, and subtle trade- offs between local traditions and cultures and external innovations. We advocate for the three tenets of environmental justice (procedure, distribution and recognition) to become the cement that will allow the connection between the two pillars of the TFCA, namely nature conservation and sustainable livelihoods in a way that will help TFCAs move towards a more convivial approach to conservation.

Abstract . The concept of vulnerability as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adap‐ tive capacity to a stressor is gaining traction outside of the climate realm, opening new avenues to address contemporary sustainability issues more holistically. Yet, critical notions that underpin vulnerability have yet to be integrated into its ap‐ plication to natural resource management and non‐climatic stressors. In particular, the way generic and stressor‐specific facets of vulnerability interact and can in‐ form decision‐makers about how interventions combine and/or trade‐off remains unexplored. . Here, we investigate the salience of the generic/specific framing in the context of Chilean artisanal fishing communities engaged in rights‐based co‐management and experiencing pressures from two stressors: poaching and market volatility. Specifically, we draw on market data combined with socio‐economic surveys con‐ ducted with 446 members and leaders from 42 fisher unions to quantitatively investigate potential trade‐offs and synergies between facets of vulnerability to poaching and markets. . Generic adaptive capacity (i.e. flexibility, assets, learning, organization and agency) likely facilitated stressor‐specific adaptive capacities to both stressors. High lev‐ els of specific adaptive capacity to one stressor neither increased exposure nor undermined specific adaptive capacity to the other stressor. However, adaptive capacity did not translate into exposure reduction as expected, suggesting that adaptation barriers may prevent fishers from mobilizing adaptive capacity into effective adaptive action. . This study illustrates how breaking down vulnerability into generic and specific facets can help us better anticipate important trade‐offs and synergies in man‐ agement interventions.

THIAULT eT AL. | INTRODUCTION
Increasingly, communities around the world are experiencing a wide array of interwoven socio‐economic and biophysical changes, including shifting market conditions, governance transforma‐ tions, environmental degradation and climate change (Cottrell et al., 2019; O'Brien & Leichenko, 2000; Scheffers et al., 2016 ) . Yet, when communities are exposed to multiple stressors, identifying synergistic leverage points, and avoiding antagonistic ones, is criti‐ cal to effectively reduce vulnerability—that is, the degree to which an entity is likely to experience harm as a result of exposure, sen‐ sitivity and adaptive capacity to a driver of change (IPCC, 2001; ; Adger, 2006 ) .
The concept of vulnerability has contributed to an emerging body of research and practice built on managing social–ecological systems more holistically. Although developed by the linked litera‐ tures of risk and hazard, political ecology, and resilience to address issues about risks and potential impacts of climate‐related stressors ( Adger, 2006; Eakin & Luers, 2006; Kasperson, Kasperson, & Turner, ; Turner et al., 2003 ) , vulnerability has recently been applied to other key themes of the contemporary sustainability discourse. The vulnerability construct has, for example, been operationalized in the context of globalization, based on a convergence of language and approaches between climate and economic changes (Leichenko & O’Brien, 2002; O’Brien & Leichenko, 2000; O’Brien et al., 2004 ) . Likewise, the incorporation of vulnerability perspectives with ideas from commons scholarship has provided practical insights to address problems surrounding management changes (Chen & Lopez‐Carr, ; Chen, López‐Carr, & Walker, 2014; Tilley & López‐Angarita, ) and resource exploitation (Thiault et al., 2018a; 2018b ) . The momentum around the possibility for managing vulnerability by tar‐ geting each dimension (i.e. reducing exposure, decreasing sensitivity, building adaptive capacity, or a combination of those) has opened an exciting space for managers and policy makers to contribute towards more integrated management of social‐ecological systems.
Despite the important potential of this emerging body of work, the use of the vulnerability construct outside of the climate circles still lacks empirical demonstrations. In particular, it is all too often assumed that any action targeting a particular source of vulnerability will invariably contribute to vulnerability reduction. However, this omits the possibility that, depending on socio‐economic conditions, structural factors, and the specific stressors at stake, different fea‐ tures can have different implications for vulnerability. The climate vulnerability literature points to two forms, or facets, of vulnerability and its dimensions. Generic facets are a core set of determinants that make people more (or less) vulnerable across a multitude of stress‐ ors. At the community scale, they are generally related to structural properties within societies, with examples such as assets, social or‐ ganization or flexibility (Cinner et al., 2018; Eakin & Lemos, 2006 ) . These contrast with specific facets that reflect the conditions and factors enabling people or communities to confront a particular stressor. In the context of climate change, these are elements critical for effective risk management such as the use of local low‐yielding but climatically robust plant varieties (Eakin, Perales, Appendini, & Sweeney, 2014 ) , diversification of resource or livelihood portfo‐ lios (Cline, Schindler, & Hilborn, 2017 ) , or flood dikes (Næss, Bang, Eriksen, & Vevatne, 2005 ) .
Understanding how generic and specific facets of vulnerability interact can reveal key avenues to sustainability and help avoid re‐ dundant or conflicting interventions (Eriksen & Brown, 2011 ) . While sustainable adaptation to a particular stressor requires high levels of both generic and specific adaptive capacities (Eakin, Lemos, & Nelson, 2014 ) , avoiding trade‐offs between these two facets re‐ mains a key challenge. Weak institutions and poverty (i.e. low ge‐ neric adaptive capacity) can for instance undermine or prevent proactive risk management locally (i.e. specific adaptive capacity ) . Conversely, building generic capacity does not automatically guar‐ antee that people will adapt effectively. Indeed, communities may be too reliant on these generic safety nets and become complacent, may not perceive the need to invest in stressor‐specific capacity, or may be unable to mobilize their capacity into effective action due to adaptation barriers (Adger & Barnett, 2009; Barnett et al., ; Eakin & Bojórquez‐Tapia, 2008; Lemos et al., 2013; Næss et al., 2005; Pomeroy, Ferrer, & Pedrajas, 2017; Saldaña‐Zorrilla, 2008 ) . Further, adaptation strategies aiming at reducing vulnerability to one stressor may also influence vulnerability to other stressors ( McDowell & Hess, 2012) because it can increase exposure to new stressors, or erode or redistribute means available for other specific adaptation (Bacon, Sundstrom, Stewart, & Beezer, 2017; Belliveau, Smit, & Bradshaw, 2006; Roncoli, Ingram, & Kirshen, 2001 ) . Despite its critical relevance to evaluate potential trade‐offs and synergies between various interventions, the generic/specific framing in as‐ sessments of vulnerability to non‐climatic stressors and natural re‐ source management has remained largely unexplored.
To address this gap, we investigate multiple vulnerabilities in re‐ lation to Chilean fisher unions, which are considered as one of the world's first artisanal fisheries co‐managed at the national level, but which are critically undermined by two key non‐climatic stressors: adaptation and vulnerability literatures in informing place‐based management of natural resources.

THIAULT eT AL. poaching and market forces. Indeed, costs associated with surveil‐ lance and poaching, and resource price fluctuation, which were perceived as the two most important problems by fishers (Gelcich et al., 2017 ) , highlight the pressing need for tackling these issues in order to improve management. Using a combination of market data and 446 semi‐structured interviews with leaders and fishers from unions, we examined the associations between generic and spe‐ cific facets of vulnerability in the context of poaching and markets. Specifically, we asked three linked research questions that are criti‐ cal for informed decision‐making: (a) Does generic capacity building translate into specific adaptive capacity? (b) Does specific adaptive capacity lead to direct adaptive action that reduces exposure? and ( c) Does building adaptive capacity to one stressor increase vulner‐ ability to the other? Our overarching goal is to move towards more robust and empirically grounded vulnerability‐based management approaches in the context of non‐climatic stressors, and more gen‐ erally to stimulate thinking on how concepts from the climate litera‐ ture can inform natural resource management. | MATERIALS AND METHODS .1 | Case study
The Chilean artisanal fleet lands more than 50% of overall marine resources in the country. A subset of the artisanal fleet composed by approximately 35,000 fishers operates a Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURF) system, possibly one of the best examples of a nationwide implementation of co‐management principles (Gelcich et al., 2010 ) . This system provides fisher unions with exclusive rights to exploit marine resources in geographically defined management areas, but also to access to the sea, land boats and construct certain buildings on the coastline (Gelcich, Edwards‐Jones, & Kaiser, 2005 ) . Resources harvested from the TURFs are subject to total allowable catch defined by the government, and unions are accountable for the stock assessments. While TURFs can provide the conditions for long term sustainability in Chile (Castilla, 2010; Gelcich, Godoy, Prado, & Castilla, 2008; Gelcich, Martínez‐Harms, Tapia‐Lewin, Vasquez‐Lavin, & Ruano‐Chamorro, 2019 ) , a number of challenges remain (Figure 1 ) .
Perhaps the most salient and persistent challenge relates to poaching and enforcement costs within TURFs, which is considered as a widespread problem by unionized fishers across Chile (Gelcich et al., 2005; ). Illegal fishing within TURFs concerns free riders who are not part of the union (external poaching ) , but also union mem‐ bers (internal poaching) that engage in resource extraction under the minimum legal size, beyond quota limits or during fishing clo‐ sures (Oyanedel, Keim, Castilla, & Gelcich, 2018 ) . Internal poaching is overseen by the unions themselves, which monitor, apprehend and apply penalties to members that infringe federal management and collectively agreed‐upon internal rules. Enforcing external poaching, on the other hand, involves a two‐tier scheme in which unionized fishers notify the government agencies of any observed breaches, with the latter being responsible for apprehending and pe‐ nalizing poachers. In practice, most of the high economic and social costs associated with poaching prevention are shifted to the fishers, which combined with a weak enforcement agency and sanctioning FI G U R E 1 Many artisanal fishing communities in Chile are organized into unions through Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURF) (a ) . Poaching within TURFs from union members and outsiders, however, represents a significant challenge to the sustainable management of the resources (b ) . The majority of catch is landed for sale to markets, which makes selling prices tightly linked to market fluctuations (c ) . The vulnerability of fisher unions to these two key stressors ultimately depends on their exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity ( a) ( b) ( c) , 2019, 4, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10056 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2022 ] .

THIAULT eT AL. system, can lead to ineffective enforcement that ultimately under‐ mines TURF outcomes and fishers livelihood (Gelcich et al., 2012 ) . Design principles for community‐based natural resource manage‐ ment suggest that conflict resolution mechanisms, clear bound‐ aries and graduated sanctions represent an effective response to poaching (Cox, Arnold, & Villamayor, 2010; Ostrom, 1990 ) . Empirical work in Chilean artisanal fishing communities also highlighted the pivotal role of surveillance effort, involvement of union members in monitoring, and communication with government agencies as key adaptation pathways to poaching at the union‐level (Davis, Kragt, Gelcich, Burton, et al., 2015; 2015; Gelcich et al., 2017; Oyanedel et al., 2018 ) .
Another pervasive stressor is market forces. Chilean artisanal fisheries are typically based on high‐value species, 95% of which are sold to markets. As a consequence, prices for most resources are directly coupled with the international seafood trades (Castilla, Espinosa, Yamashiro, Melo, & Gelcich, 2016; Defeo et al., 2016) and may easily increase or decrease threefold from one year to another, depending on global market conditions. High market price volatil‐ ity directly exposes fishers to the inconsistency of new markets and demand and often coincides with exposition to unmanageable price fluctuations, ultimately impacting fishers’ income (Béné & Doyen, ; Crona et al., 2016 ) . In addition, fishers typically have a choice between transporting their catches to the nearest marketplace, and selling them to middlemen who travel between unions and markets. For remote unions, uncertainty about market prices is usually high and middlemen may take advantage of fishers’ ignorance over mar‐ ket prices and extract a rent from them by offering very low prices for their catch. The linkages between the fishery and global trade can also result in strong and persistent price drops that can signifi‐ cantly influence benefits union members get from their TURF. For example, Chilean export prices of key TURF species such as the loco ( Concholepas concholepas) have dropped considerably following the development of aquaculture farming for the abalone (Haliotis spp. ) , a substitute species in the global market (Castilla et al., 2016 ) . In re‐ sponse to market changes, and although long‐ and short‐term prices fluctuations are decoupled from direct local management practices, unions can invest in various strategies to reduce their exposure to markets impacts. For instance, they may diversify catch and gear to adapt their catch to price changes (Aguilera et al., 2015; Cline et al., 2017; Defeo et al., 2016 ) , improve communications with market‐ places (Jacinto & Pomeroy, 2011 ) , and develop trust and reciprocity with the middlemen to increase their bargaining power when selling products (Pomeroy & Andrew, 2011; Ponte, Raakjaer, & Campling, ). .2 | Conceptualizing social vulnerability in natural resource management
To evaluate fisher unions’ vulnerability to markets and poaching, we used the vulnerability framework developed in the IPCC’s Third ( IPCC, 2001) and Fourth (IPCC, 2007) Assessment Reports using a top‐down/quantitative approach (Brugère & De Young, 2015 ) . The IPCC framework describes vulnerability broadly in terms of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. These three sweeping concepts—or dimensions—are useful because they encompass the broad diversity of entities and stressors that may be considered in a vulnerability assessment (Tonmoy, El‐Zein, & Hinkel, 2014 ) . Each dimension is however multifaceted and potentially context‐specific. Therefore, most evaluations further break down each first‐tier variables (the dimensions) into second‐tier variables, here called domains (Carpenter & Brock, 2004; Cinner et al., 2018; Marshall, Fenton, Marshall, & Sutton, 2007; Marshall & Marshall, 2007 ) . The domains are the features of the system's Dimension that are most critical to conferring vulnerability in the particular context of the study. They are heuristics that help practitioners organize their in‐ quiries of vulnerability and, while there are no ‘correct’ domains, it is crucial that they fit the context of the study, and are anchored in relevant theories. Bellow, we describe each dimension and associ‐ ated domains and facets (generic vs. stressor‐specific) with a focus on situations relevant to natural resource management and non‐cli‐ mate stressors.
In its most broad sense, the Exposure dimension assesses the magnitude, frequency, duration and/or extent in which people are in contact with, or subject to, a particular stressor (Kasperson et al., ). Therefore, exposure is by essence stressor‐specific. People can be exposed to stressors in a direct manner, for example in the case of earthquakes, diseases or fire risk. In most cases relevant to natural resource management, however, stressors are considered via their impact on one or more elements linking ecosystems to users’ well‐being (Daw et al., 2016 ) . In our case for example, exposure to poaching, which includes all forms of illegal fishing within TURFs, does not affect fishers directly but instead alters the condition of the resource fishers depend upon. Likewise, market price variability may affect fishers’ well‐being indirectly via impacts on the benefits (i.e. income) fishers derive from catch sell.
The Sensitivity dimension captures the set of conditions and characteristics that mediate people's propensity to be influenced by the Exposure (Bousquet et al., 2015 ) . When exposure involves a di‐ rect pathway, sensitivity is not separable from exposure and is thus stressor‐specific (Smit & Wandel, 2006 ) . For example, sensitivity to earthquakes, diseases or fire exposure are not determined by the same features. When stressors affect people indirectly via impacts on the chain linking ecosystems to human well‐being (Daw et al., ), sensitivity is primarily determined by the degree to which people rely upon this chain (Daw et al., 2016; Depietri, 2019; Thiault et al., 2018b ) , or ecosystem services dependency. Dependency is multifaceted and, depending on the focus of the study, may include nutritional, economic, social, cultural, psychological domains, or a combination of those (Marshall et al., 2017; Selig et al., 2019 ) . Where is the appropriate place to draw the line between Sensitivity that is generic or stressor‐specific? This needs to be defined with reference to the scope of research being undertaken: a broad perspective on vulnerability would consider sensitivity as stressor‐specific (for ex‐ ample, markets and poaching could be considered separate stress‐ ors and thus sensitivity could be specific to each ) .

THIAULT eT AL. natural resource management perspective would consider stressors as specific or generic based on whether they have similar or differ‐ ent impact pathways (i.e. chain of elements linking ecosystems to human well‐being ) , respectively (Allison et al., 2009; Cinner et al., , 2012; Hughes et al., 2012; Islam, Sallu, Hubacek, & Paavola, ; Marshall, Marshall, & Abdulla, 2009; Thiault et al., 2018b ) . In our case, we adopt the latter perspective, and treat sensitivity as generic to the two stressors we examine (because they both occur through the same impact pathway ) , but these would clearly not be generic to other categories of stressors such as earthquakes.
The Adaptive capacity dimension captures people's ability to con‐ front or address changes by mitigating, coping with, and recovering from the potential impact (i.e. the combination of exposure and sen‐ sitivity) of a stressor. At the community level, adaptive capacity has both generic and specific facets (Eakin, Lemos, et al., 2014; Lemos, Lo, Nelson, Eakin, & Bedran‐Martins, 2016) that can be reflected in five key domains (Cinner et al., 2013 ) : The flexibility domain captures the opportunities that communities have for switching between ad‐ aptation strategies, while the agency domain reflects their ability to have free choice in responding to change. To adapt, people can also draw upon individually owned and public goods such as financial, technological, and service resources; these are captured in the assets domain. The organization domain captures the formal and informal ways in which individuals are organized to enable cooperation, col‐ lective action, and knowledge sharing, and reflects trust and social cohesion within the community. Finally, the learning domain assesses people's capacity to generate, absorb, and process new information about current and future stressors, adaptation options, and ways to live with and manage change. .3 | Operationalizing social vulnerability to poaching and markets
In the context of this study, fisher unions’ vulnerabilities to poaching and markets entails stressor‐specific exposure, generic sensitivity, and generic and specific adaptive capacity (Figure 2 ) .
We operationalized vulnerability (Figure 2) using measurable in‐ dicators collected in 2014 as part of a socio‐economic survey con‐ ducted in 42 Chilean fisher unions engaged with the TURF regime. Overall, our study area covers all 12 coastal regions between Arica ( North) and Los Lagos (South ) , spanning a 2,700 km coastline where most unions concentrate (Gelcich et al., 2017 ) . In each study site, we conducted two different types of semi‐structured interviews to cap‐ ture union‐scale (where there exists only one value per fisher union) and individual‐scale (where there are different observations for each fisher) information. For the union‐scale aspects, we interviewed one leader of each fisher union (n = 42 ) . For the individual‐scale aspects, we targeted a random sample of 10 fishermen from these unions. The number was achieved in 39 unions but only seven and three fishers were respectively surveyed in two and one unions as fishers were unwilling to participate in one union and overall number of fish‐ ers actively working in the other union constrained sample size. A total of 407 complete individual surveys were obtained. Both ques‐ tionnaires included multiple choice questions, ranking exercises and Likert‐type scale responses, and were conducted in Spanish by four trained interviewers. All interviews were recorded anonymously with free and prior informed consent. Participants were informed of the research objectives and use of data, and were given contact information as well as the option not to answer any question or leave FI G U R E 2 IPCC’s vulnerability framework adapted for our multi‐stressor assessment in the context of natural resource management. Here, exposure refers to the extent to which a fisher union is subject to a stressor and sensitivity refers to the fishers’ dependency on the ecosystem services for livelihood. Adaptive capacity refers to their ability to confront changes by mitigating, coping with, and recovering from exposure and sensitivity, and has both generic and specific facets. Note that we narrowly consider sensitivity as generic since, in our context, stressors affect people via the same impact pathway. One might consider sensitivity as specific if exposure involves unique impact pathways.

THIAULT eT AL. the survey when they wished. The study and its methodology were approved by the Pontificia Universidad Católica Ethics Committee ( reference 150730011 ) . In addition to interviews, we obtained mar‐ ket data from the Chilean Undersecretary of Fisheries (SUBPESCA ) , which consisted of monthly species prices and landings between January 2005 and January 2015 at the national‐ and union‐level, respectively.
Together, interviews and market data provided quantitative infor‐ mation on 17 theoretically‐ and empirically grounded indicators that inferred indirectly on various domains of generic and specific facets of vulnerability dimensions (Table 1 and Supporting Information ) . When possible, several indicators were used to depict particular do‐ mains in order to reduce the effect of potential mismeasurement and triangulate more accurate values. For sensitivity, we were only able to capture the economic dependency domain with a single indicator. We were able to include the five domains of generic facets of adap‐ tive capacity with one or two indicators each. We only incorporated domains of specific adaptive capacity for which we had empirical ev‐ idence. These include the role of assets such as support for surveil‐ lance (Arias, Pressey, Jones, Álvarez‐Romero, & Cinner, 2016; Davis, Kragt, Gelcich, Schilizzi, et al., 2015; Oyanedel et al., 2018) and or‐ ganization through graduated sanctions to adapt to poaching (Cox et al., 2010; Ostrom, 1990 ) , as well as flexibility and organization via in‐ creased gear diversity and collective bargaining power, respectively, to respond to market changes (Béné, Macfadyen, & Allison, 2007; Cline et al., 2017; Matsue, Daw, & Garrett, 2014 ) .
Each of the 17 indicators was standardized to a scale ranging from 0 (minimum possible value) to 1 (maximum possible value) fol‐ lowing Gustafson et al., (2016 ) . We aggregated indicators using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution; Tzeng & Huang, 2011) method. We used a hierarchical weighting scheme designed so that (a) each dimension contributes equally to vulnerability and (b) the relative contribution of each in‐ dicator to each dimension depends on the total number of such in‐ dicators analysed under a particular domain nested in a particular facet (Table 1; see Figure S1 for illustration of the weighting scheme ) . We analysed unions’ vulnerability to poaching and markets at two aggregation levels: at the facet‐level (i.e. generic adaptive capacity and sensitivity, specific exposure and adaptive capacity to poaching and specific exposure and adaptive capacity to markets) and at the overall vulnerability‐level (i.e. vulnerability to poaching and vulner‐ ability to markets ) . This yielded facet‐ and overall vulnerability‐level scores for each fisher union which we finally standardized between (lowest possible score) and 1 (highest possible score) for ease of interpretation. See Supporting Information for full details on aggre‐ gation and weighting methods. .4 | Examining interactions among vulnerability facets
Previous studies exploring the interactions between generic and spe‐ cific facets of vulnerability have tended to focus on few study sites using in‐depth longitudinal data (Belliveau et al., 2006; Lemos et al., ; McDowell & Hess, 2012; Nelson, Lemos, Eakin, & Lo, 2016; Roncoli et al., 2001 ) . Such design enables to compare how facets changed following a disaster or an intervention targeting a particular facet. In our case, however, it was not feasible to identify a strict “be‐ fore” period given the long history of many fisher unions (Gelcich et al., ), the long‐lasting manifestation of poaching and market forces, and the absence of policy interventions specifically designed to tackle these issues. Our study design however includes a range of fisher un‐ ions with different local socio‐economic arrangements (Gelcich et al., ) that may lead to a variety of vulnerability configurations. This heterogeneity may in turn unveil how various configurations of vul‐ nerability facets can or cannot co‐occur. Drawing on generalized ideas about adaptation and vulnerability to climate change, we identified three concerns that could potentially hinder vulnerability‐based man‐ agement in natural resource management settings (Table 2 ) .
The first concern relates to the interplay between generic and specific adaptive capacities. Indeed, the two facets of adaptive ca‐ pacity can sometimes be mutually exclusive (Lemos et al., 2013 ) . In our fisheries context, this trade‐off situation may for instance occur if, in response to markets exposure (i.e. lower or highly volatile reve‐ nue from landings ) , unions rely too much on generic adaptive capacity ( e.g. assets, social safety nets, etc.) and do not develop stressor‐spe‐ cific adaptive capacity that would help them altering exposure more directly (e.g. improving bargaining power and gear diversity to nego‐ tiate better selling prices with the middlemen and adapt their catch composition to market demand, respectively ) . In such a case, spe‐ cific and generic adaptive capacities would be associated negatively. Conversely, adaptive capacity may also involve a co‐dependent, or synergistic association between generic capacity and its specific counterpart (Brooks, Adger, & Kelly, 2005; Lemos et al., 2013; 2016 ) , for instance if generic adaptive capacity is channelled effectively to build specific adaptive capacity. This would be reflected here by a positive relationship between generic and specific capacities.
The second concern relates to the case where specific adaptive capacity does not lead to direct adaptive action. Fisher unions with high specific adaptive capacity have the means to directly alter their exposure, because they are both operators and receptors of their adaptive actions (Eisenack & Stecker, 2012 ) . Just like in the example of markets above where gear diversity and bargaining power may enable fishers to reduce the effect of markets on their livelihood, fishers can potentially mobilize poaching‐specific adap‐ tive capacity (e.g. increase surveillance effort and use graduated sanctions) to reduce their exposure to poaching (e.g. reduced illegal fishing from outsiders and insiders, respectively ) . In this case, spe‐ cific adaptive capacity to a stressor would be negatively associated with exposure to that same stressor. However, adaptation barri‐ ers and missing ‘mobilizing factors’ may prevent adaptive capacity to translate into actual adaptive action (Adger & Barnett, 2009; Eisenack & Stecker, 2012 ) . For instance, even with the best adap‐ tive capacity available, fisher unions may fail to perceive the need to adapt, or may not employ it effectively enough to markedly alter their exposure. This would create a positive or neutral relationship between specific adaptive capacity and exposure to the stressor. , 2019, 4, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10056 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2022 ] .

The third potential concern we examined relates to maladap‐ tation, and describes the case where building adaptive capacity to one stressor increases vulnerability to another stressor (Adger & Barnett, 2009; Barnett & O’Neill, 2010 ) . This may occur if ca‐ pacity building targeting one specific stressor crowds out capacity building targeting another (Barnett et al., 2015; Barnett & O’Neill, ) or increases exposure to that other stressor (Eakin, 2005 ) . In our case, fisher unions may for instance choose to invest in spe‐ cific capacity to address poaching, but this may be at the expense of the development of specific adaptive capacity and/or exposure reduction to markets due to limited time, resources or competing concerns. Such maladaptation scenario would be reflected here by a negative association between specific adaptive capacities and/or a positive association between specific adaptive capacity to one stressor and exposure to the other. The direction of asso‐ ciations would be reversed if synergies were involved instead of trade‐offs. Note that although capacity building to one stressor may also increase sensitivity to other stressors (Bacon et al., 2017; Belliveau et al., 2006; Roncoli et al., 2001 ) , we did not consider this scenario because sensitivity is here generic and does not vary between stressors (Figure 2 ) .
We examined these three challenges by quantifying the direction and strength of their relationships between the relevant facets. We used pairwise Spearman rank correlations with p‐values adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. This correlative approach works under the assumption that other broad factors shap‐ ing social vulnerability are held constant across the study area (Smit & Wandel, 2006 ) . This assumption is reasonable considering that fisher unions are ruled under the same governance framework (Gelcich et al., 2010) and that the effects of other socio‐economic (e.g. global trade) or environmental stressors (e.g. ENSO) remain evenly distrib‐ uted along the Chilean coast (Sielfeld, Laudien, Vargas, & Villegas, Dimension

To test the robustness of our analyses and account for uncertainty in our weighting scheme, we recalculated facet‐level scores and pair‐ wise correlations between facets 1,000 times with combinations of weight values randomly drawn from a uniform distribution bound by the original weight values (Table 1) ± 20%, and then recorded the number of times a significant correlation at ⍺ = 0.05 was observed.
All analyses were performed using the R statistical software (R Core Team, 2017 ) . | RESULTS
Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacities varied substantially across study sites and from one stressor to the other. Exposure to poaching ranged from total compliance to total non‐compliance with rules (Figures 3 and 4 ) . Exposure to markets was also heterogeneous across unions, with some experiencing stable (low monthly variability) and sometimes increasing market prices and others—especially those located in the North—volatile and decreasing prices (Figures 3 and 4 ) . About 85% (n = 36) and 45% (n = 19) of fisher unions scored lower than .5 in specific adaptive capacity to markets and poaching, respectively. Curanipe, Los Molles and Maitencillo had the highest level of generic adaptive capacity because they scored high in all of the five domains, while San Marcos, Carrizal Bajo and Puertecillo scored low in most do‐ mains, particularly in Learning and Organization (Figure 3 and Figure S2 ) .
The facet‐level analysis highlighted strong positive associa‐ tions between generic and specific adaptive capacity (ρ = 0.77; p‐value <.001 for markets, and ρ = 0.74; p‐value <.001 for poach‐ ing ) , although they have been estimated with different indicators ( Table 1 ) . Additionally, fisher unions that scored high in specific adap‐ tive capacity to markets tended to also have high exposure to mar‐ kets (ρ = 0.43; p‐value = .024) and high adaptive capacity to poaching ( ρ = .49; p‐value = .006 ) . We found no significant association between exposure and specific adaptive capacity to poaching (ρ = −0.002; p‐ value = 1 ) . We examined how different indicator weightings affected the relationships between the different facets of vulnerability, and found they had little impact on the direction and significance of the correlations (Figure 4 ) , providing high confidence in the results de‐ rived from the original weighting scheme (Table 1 ) .
Despite the positive relationships among various facets of vul‐ nerability, the overall vulnerability of fisher unions to one stressor was not necessarily related to the vulnerability to the other stressor ( ρ = 0.31; p‐value = .05; Figure 5 ) . Social vulnerability was unevenly distributed with no evident spatial pattern and a high range of varia‐ tion across fisher unions, regardless of the stressor considered. | DISCUSSION
When applied to natural resource management, vulnerability as‐ sessments can help practitioners target where particular policy and management interventions are best fitted to maximize outcomes. Vulnerability assessments that incorporate a generic/specific framing are particularly useful because they enable practitioners to explicitly evaluate trade‐offs or synergies between diverse intervention options ( Eakin, Lemos, et al., 2014; Lemos et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2016 ) . Here, we work towards integration of this key notion into the context of non‐climatic stressors associated to natural resource management.
Insights from the climate adaptation literature suggest that vul‐ nerability should be reduced by jointly addressing structural (i.e. ge‐ neric) and stressor‐specific facets. However, addressing one could potentially undermine the other (Eakin, Lemos, et al., 2014; Lemos et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2016 ) . Here, we found a positive rela‐ tionship between generic and stressor‐specific adaptive capacities. This suggests that far from being mutually exclusive, these two fac‐ ets can be closely and positively interdependent. Some generic el‐ ements of adaptive capacity may contribute to the development of stressor‐specific adaptive capacity. This may also explain the absence of trade‐offs between specific adaptive capacities to markets and poaching, respectively. Livelihoods diversification programs (Torell, McNally, Crawford, & Majubwa, 2017 ) , approaches to poverty allevi‐ ation (Allison & Ellis, 2001 ) , investments in infrastructure and mate‐ rial assets (McClanahan et al., 2008 ) , or social capital building (Cinner et al., 2018; Marin, Gelcich, Castilla, & Berkes, 2012) are among the options available to policymakers to directly lower people's sensitiv‐ ity and enhance certain domains of generic adaptive capacity.
Despite the presence of shared (i.e. generic) facets and their positive associations with their specific counterpart, we found no association between vulnerability to poaching and vulnerability to markets. Hence, lowering vulnerability to multiple stressors re‐ quires developing portfolios of interventions that not only target generic facets, but also focus on specific ones.

THIAULT eT AL. may run the risk that interventions to reduce vulnerability to one stressor inadvertently increase the exposure to other stressors ( Bacon et al., 2017; Belliveau et al., 2006; Finkbeiner et al., 2017; McDowell & Hess, 2012; Roncoli et al., 2001 ) . Support for this narrative is not confined to discussions on climate change. The resource management literature highlights that, in some cases, interventions may generate unintended new exposure to a vari‐ ety of demographic (e.g. in‐migration, gentrification ) , health (e.g. acute diseases, injuries, or emotional distress) and cultural drivers ( e.g. shifts in traditional practices and organization) (Aswani et al., ; Bennett, Blythe, Tyler, & Ban, 2016; Christie, 2004; Gelcich, Edwards‐Jones, Kaiser, & Castilla, 2006 ) . Our finding that high spe‐ cific adaptive capacity to one stressor was not associated with high exposure to the other suggests that trade‐offs across stressor‐spe‐ cific interventions may not be involved, or may be present but not exert substantial effects. However, our analysis solely focuses on two stressors and therefore neglects other potential maladapta‐ tion pathways. Indeed, interventions tailored to address problems in one context may not only increase exposure to other stressors, but could also trigger unforeseen negative consequences in other systems (e.g. marine resource ) , sectors (e.g. tourism) or social groups (e.g. non‐unionized fishers) (Finkbeiner et al., 2017 ) .

THIAULT eT AL. integrative understanding of trade‐offs will enable vulnerability as‐ sessments to more fully inform management and avoid maladaptive strategies (Barnett & O’Neill, 2010 ) .
By design, the vulnerability framework as used in the natural re‐ source management focuses on the interactions between resource users and stressors that can be altered by users themselves, at least to some extent (Thiault et al., 2018b; Tilley & López‐Angarita, 2016 ) . Users are thus simultaneously considered as the ‘exposure unit’ (i.e. they are the ones exposed to the stressor ) , the operators (i.e. they are the ones that can exercise the response by mobilizing adaptive capacity) and the receptors of their adaptive action (i.e. their ac‐ tions can improve their own situation by reducing their exposure) ( Eisenack & Stecker, 2012 ) . This straightforward case, where adap‐ tations are manifestations of adaptive capacity and represent direct FI G U R E 4 Associations between the generic and specific facets of vulnerability to poaching and markets in Chilean fisher unions ( n=42 ) .

THIAULT eT AL. ways of reducing exposure, means that examining their interactions can provide insights into the theoretical assumption that capacity translates to action (Mortreux & Barnett, 2017 ) .
Our results suggest that policy and management interventions focusing solely on capacity building may be only partly effective at lowering exposure to non‐climate stressors. Indeed, the absence of negative association between specific adaptive capacity and ex‐ posure—regardless of the stressor considered—suggests that high specific adaptive capacity does not automatically lead to effective exposure reduction. In fact, specific adaptive capacity and expo‐ sure were positively related in the context of markets, meaning that unions with the highest gear diversity and bargaining power tended to be more exposed to unfavourable markets conditions. Since fish‐ ers recognize the importance of markets variability on their activity ( Gelcich et al., 2017 ) , the fact that fisher's unions with high capacity do not lower effectively their exposure might suggest that some mobilizing factors are lacking (Mortreux & Barnett, 2017 ) . The ab‐ sence of relationship between poaching‐specific adaptive capacity and exposure is also likely the result of underlying inhibiting factors related to risk appraisal and self‐efficacy (Oyanedel et al., 2018 ) . In has been shown in other contexts that what hinders adaptation ac‐ tions is not just a lack of adaptive capacity (Adger & Barnett, 2009; Adger et al., 2009; Barnett et al., 2015; Eisenack & Stecker, 2012; IPCC, 2007; Smit & Wandel, 2006 ) .
In order to foster communities’ adaptation actions, policy and management should target interventions aimed not only at building adaptive capacity but also at removing adaptation barriers. Although further research is warranted to identify these barriers in the specific context of Chilean artisanal fisheries, possible avenues for market‐re‐ lated management interventions may include environmental certifi‐ cation and eco‐labelling to stabilize demand and market prices, and increase catch value (Roheim, Asche, & Insignares, 2011 ) . Improved trade and markets information systems may also help fishers bet‐ ter anticipate price changes. Interventions fostering adaptation to poaching may include refined spatial design and clear boundaries to help avoid accidental poaching (Day et al., 2012 ) , while enforcement subsidies (Sumaila, Lam, Le Manach, Swartz, & Pauly, 2016 ) , train‐ ing programs (Akella & Cannon, 2004 ) , and communication to union members about the benefits of enforcing and complying with the rules (Davis, Kragt, Gelcich, Schilizzi, et al., 2015) could help change norms and foster voluntary compliance (Bergseth, Gurney, Barnes, Arias, & Cinner, 2018 ) . Oyanedel et al. (2018) also stressed the impor‐ tance, in Chile, of improving the reporting processes to ensure effec‐ tive responses from government agencies when illegal activities are reported and improve the sentiment of self‐efficacy among fishers.
As we used here a framework initially developed for assessing vulnerability to climate change, we adapted the socio‐economic indicators to ensure they capture well the vulnerability domains related to our natural resource management case study. While the domains of exposure and adaptive capacity are well represented here, cultural and psychological domains of sensitivity are not be‐ cause they are difficult to capture in an objective and quantitative manner across a large range of fisher's communities.

THIAULT eT AL. indicators (Dacks et al., 2019; Sterling et al., 2017) could yield different results and, in particular, reveal new trade‐offs. In ad‐ dition, since the boundaries between generic and specific aspects of vulnerability may be less clear cut than assumed here (Adger & Vincent, 2005; Eakin & Lemos, 2006; Metcalf et al., 2015; Tol & Yohe, 2007 ) , synergies or trade‐offs may occur not only between facets but also among domains and across scales and systems ( Adger, 2003; Cinner et al., 2018; Engle & Lemos, 2010 ) . More re‐ search is needed to: (a) better integrate biocultural and in‐depth qualitative approaches into vulnerability assessments; (b) better understand how the interactions among various interventions ul‐ timately affect social vulnerability; (c) reliably identify the barriers and limitations to local adaptive actions.
Our study highlights how distinguishing generic from specific facets of vulnerability provides a useful entry point to evaluate di‐ verse trade‐offs and synergies in natural resource management. It illustrates how the vulnerability framework can inform place‐based strategies to address important resource management challenges. Thus, this approach may be particularly relevant to inform the on‐ going shift towards polycentric management of marine resources. Replication of this approach to other settings and stressors will strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms facilitating or un‐ dermining management interventions, which will help practitioners better navigate the many stressors that increasingly threaten re‐ source dependent communities around the world.

Handling Editor: Rachelle Gould Abstract . Coastal systems provide many cultural ecosystem services (CES) to humans. Fewer studies have focused solely on CES, while those comparing CES across countries are even rarer. In the case of shellfish, considerable ecosystem services focus has been placed on nutrient remediation, with relatively little on the cultural services provided, despite strong historical, cultural, social and economic links between shellfish and coastal communities. The ecosystem services provided by the common cockle, Cerastoderma edule, have recently been described, yet the cultural benefits from cockles remain mostly unknown. . Here, we documented the CES provided by C. edule in five maritime countries along the Atlantic coast of western Europe, classifying evidenced examples of services into an a priori framework. The high- level classes, adapted from the Millennium Assessment and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services, were: inspirational, sense of place, spiritual & religious, aesthetic, recreation & ecotourism, cultural heritage and educational. A further 19 sub- classes were defined. We followed a narrative approach to draw out commonalities and differences among countries using a semi- quantitative analysis. . Examples of CES provided by cockles were found for all classes in most countries.

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. | INTRODUCTION
Cultural ecosystem services (CES) encompass ‘the non- material services of ecosystems that affect the physical and mental well- being of people’ (Fish et al., 2016; Haines- Young & Potschin, 2017 ) . Shaped by human– nature interactions (Jones et al., 2016 ) , CES are obtained from the ecosystem through ‘spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation and aesthetic experiences’ (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA ) , 2005 ) . Despite the increasing number of studies addressing CES, these are some of the most challenging ecosystem services to characterise, quantify, integrate and link to specific ecosystem attributes (Blicharska et al., 2017; Daniel et al., 2012; Gould et al., 2019 ) . CES differ from other ecosystem services as they are hard to define, mostly not observable, particularly difficult to link with changes in natural environmental processes and lack distinct measurement boundaries (Cooper et al., 2016; Fish et al., 2016 ) . Research on CES is often limited to recreational and aesthetic indicators as these are more easily quantified (Hernández- Morcillo et al., 2013; Milcu et al., 2013 ) , widening the division between what is perceived to be important to people and what is actually studied (Milcu et al., 2013 ) . Useful alternatives exist for describing values associated with CES, such as linking biophysical attributes to experiential qualities of a landscape. However, these approaches predominantly focus on the landscape (Bieling & Plieninger, 2013; Norton et al., 2012) and rarely include the whole range of CES. There is thus a lack of quantitative assessment of the whole range of CES due to difficulties in adopting a suitable methodology and tangible indicators (but see Cabana et al., 2020 ) . In addition, most of the research on CES remains largely focused on terrestrial ecosystems with little attention to the coastal environment (Drakou et al., 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2017 ) .
Some 40% of the world's human population lives in coastal areas (UNEP, 2006) and coastal habitats provide the society with a range of goods and services that are both economically and socially important to human well- being (Costanza, 1999; van der Schatte Olivier et al., 2018 ) . As well as provisioning, regulating and supporting services, marine and coastal ecosystems provide a number of CES that are greatly appreciated by the public and people who depend on them for their livelihood (Ahtiainen et al., 2019; Brookfield et al., 2005; Paracchini et al., 2014 ) . Activities such as harvest and aquaculture production of finfish and shellfish provide economic, social and cultural goods especially in remote and economically disadvantaged coastal areas (Krause et al., 2018; Urquhart et al., 2014 ) . As such, a strong cultural identity is often found within fishing communities and the practice of fishing is frequently characterised across multiple generations as a way of life rather than a means of earning a living (Brookfield et al., 2005; Urquhart et al., 2014; van Ginkel, 2001 ) . Similarly, bivalve culture has been shown to act as a crucial activity for local ‘meaning- making’ shaping the cultural identities of place and ownership (Krause et al., 2018 ) .
Universal classifications of CES such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES; Haines- Young & Potschin, 2018) are useful tools for comparative studies, particularly beyond national scales. The relative importance of CES may vary across nations and individuals with diverse socio- economic backgrounds (Ahtiainen et al., 2019; Brown & Hausner, 2017; Czajkowski et al., 2015; Milcu et al., 2013; Paracchini et al., 2014 ) . Cultural heritage, for instance, is intricately linked with history and human experiences and, as a result, heritage associations with the same ecosystem features are likely to vary across cultures (Daniel et al., 2012 ) . For example, CES provided by the Baltic Sea marine environment were perceived differently across countries, and between users and nonusers of the Baltic Sea (Ahtiainen et al., 2019 ) . Cross- country differences were attributed to the characteristics of the three countries (including Europe, making it an ideal model species to study CES in coastal areas. Most examples were in cultural heritage, highlighting the importance of this class in comparison with classes which typically receive more attention in the literature like recreation or aesthetics. We also found that the cultural associations with cockles differed among countries, including between neighbouring countries that share a strong maritime heritage. The extent to which cultural associations were linked with the present or past also differed among countries, with stronger association with the present in southern countries and with the past in the north. . Understanding the wider benefits of cockles could deepen the recognition of this important coastal resource, and contribute to promoting sustainable management practices, through greater engagement with local communities. This study is an important step towards better integration of CES in coastal environments and could be used as a framework to study the CES of other species or ecosystems.

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. size and population density) as well as cultural factors (Ahtiainen et al., 2019 ) . Strong local anchoring of cultural traditions may also play a role. Recreational activity has received the most attention in cross- country comparisons in the literature, and there is a need to assess other types of CES, using a variety of approaches that take into account the complexity of definitions and interpretations of CES.
Comprehensive assessments of the suite of ecosystem services provided by shellfish for both cultured and wild- harvested bivalve species (see Carss et al., 2020; Smaal et al., 2019; van der Schatte Olivier et al., 2018) highlight that the importance of cultural services provided by bivalves is gaining increasing recognition. It has been suggested that knowledge of CES is more likely to motivate engagement from the public in restoration or new aquaculture initiatives than knowledge of provisioning, regulating or supporting services ( Michaelis et al., 2020 ) . Yet the CES associated with bivalves still remain poorly researched and quantified (Carss et al., 2020; van der Schatte Olivier et al., 2018 ) .
The common cockle, Cerastoderma edule, is one of the dominant non- cultured bivalve species harvested along western European coastlines, and has a broad distribution extending from the coast of West Africa to Norway (Dabouineau & Ponsero, 2009; Malham et al., 2012 ) . Related species are distributed world- wide and provide similar ecological roles. This cultural relevance to individuals and society is reflected in evidence of interactions passing down generations through historical, contemporary art and the folklore associated with them (Carss et al., 2020 ) . It is clear, however, that further work is needed for a more holistic understanding of CES in cockles, especially beyond national borders.
In this study, we aimed to collate evidence for the contribution of the common cockle C. edule to human well- being and society among countries along the European Atlantic Coast. The specific aims of this study were to: (a) develop a structured approach to quantifying CES; (b) use that structured approach to collate examples of the wider benefits of cockles to humans and (c) explore inter- country differences in the social and cultural benefits gained from cockles. The intention was to draw on the accumulated knowledge of experts and stakeholders with a strong understanding and experience of cockles, rather than a survey of public perceptions of cockles. | METHODS
The study was performed through a face- to- face workshop, and a series of virtual meetings and follow- up activities with small incountry teams of experts and stakeholders from five countries: France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the UK. The study was coordinated as part of a research and industry collaboration, under the COCKLES project ‘Co- operation for restoring cockle shellfisheries and its ecosystem services in the Atlantic Area’, co- funded through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF ) . The participating institutions comprise many of the main research, governmental and non- governmental organisations working on cockles in the five countries. Participants in the study included (numbers of participants in brackets ) : members of non- governmental organisations ( 3 ) , representatives of regulatory bodies (7 ) , representatives from eight different cockle fisheries co- operatives (11 ) , social scientists ( 3 ) , economists (3 ) , natural scientists covering a range of expertise from ecology, biogeochemistry, hydrodynamic modelling to genetics and disease (22 ) , and a few less easily classified stakeholders including a chef, archaeologists and an anthropologist (4 ) . The first meeting comprised a face- to- face workshop held in Vigo in north- west Spain, 10 April 2018, with 28 participants from 11 organisations. Recognising that the terminology used in ecosystem services is not always clear (Norgaard, 2010 ) , a presentation was given at the start to all participants illustrating examples visually and using everyday language to describe the different types of information being sought in the workshop. Participants were then split into three groups, each focusing on 2– 3 sub- categories in the classification: Group : Aesthetic, Inspirational; Group 2: Sense of place, Recreation & Ecotourism; Group 3: Spiritual & Religious, Cultural heritage, Educational. Group membership was designed to ensure a diversity of country representatives and expertise in each, particularly balancing natural science and other perspectives, and each group had a facilitator to guide the discussion. After the group work, each group reported back followed by further discussion of ideas and examples among all participants in plenary. As described above, the aim was not to get independent information from different individuals or groups, but to achieve a common understanding of the task from many different perspectives, and to stimulate creative thinking about cultural benefits of the cockle. The collective view here aims for a better reflection of CES provided by cockles than could be gained from individual responses, as the deliberative process can help reveal shared values and the more elusive details of CES (Fish et al., 2011; Gould et al., 2019; Kenter, Bryce, et al., 2016 ) . The workshop was followed up over the following months by smaller countryspecific meetings, mostly held by teleconference call or video call and by email. Each country completed their entries in the template spreadsheet provided. Once this first draft was completed, it was circulated to all participants (again to stimulate missed ideas ) . This was followed up by a second round of smaller focused meetings with a representative from each country to check on potential information gaps. The role of the facilitators in both the initial workshop and subsequent follow- up meetings was to ensure balanced discussion, in order to minimise ‘social desirability bias’ emerging in the examples provided (Kaplowitz & Hoehn, 2001; Raymond et al., 2014 ) .
An a priori framework defined the major classes and sub- classes of CES broadly based on the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( CICES v5.1; Haines- Young & Potschin, 2017; MEA, 2005; Table 1 ) . The CICES classification included Division, Groups, Class and Class type. CES were divided in two divisions, direct or indirect interactions. These were further categorised into groups (CICES codes in brackets ) , namely: ‘Physical and Experiential (3.1.1 ) ’, ‘Intellectual and Representative (3.1.2 ) ’ for direct interactions, and ‘Spiritual or Symbolic (3.2.1 ) ’ and other ‘non- use (3.2.2 ) ’ for indirect interactions. , 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10252 by Universite De Bordeaux, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2022 ] .

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al.
The groups were subsequently categorised into classes that we developed and adapted from the Millennium Assessment. From these classes, we then created the sub- classes with a more detailed specification for the CES provided by cockles (Table 1 ) . The framework was tested with pilot data from one country, and revised to accommodate difficulties in assigning examples to classes. The framework was then distributed among participants with the request to document examples from their country, aligned within the framework wherever possible. Examples of CES were collated and checked for possible missing information during the face- to- face workshop and bi- lateral follow- up activities with in- country teams. Examples which did not easily fit the framework could also be suggested. Allocation of examples to classes and sub- classes was checked by the lead authors. At this stage, any un- allocated examples were also assigned to the closest class in the framework. Some specific examples were allocated to different classes depending on what they represented. So, statues and sculptures were assigned to ‘symbolic’ where they represented a cultural icon or theme, and to ‘inspirational’ where they were more abstract or artistic. For one sub- class (Education & Research ) , the method used differed slightly, due to the nature of the data and the most appropriate way to collate this. In order to quantify the scientific literature on cockles, literature searches were run in Web of Science on the 11th November 2020 using ‘Cerastoderma edule’ as a search term. Publication records were allocated to the country of origin using the analysis result function of Web of Science. The scientific name was used for two reasons: to pick up the wider scientific literature published in languages other than English, and because the common name ‘cockle’ is frequently used for other related and un- related species world- wide.
Once collated, examples within each sub- class were then described using a narrative approach. To enable data visualisation, the information for each sub- class was summarised in quantitative form ( Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998 ) , by assigning a score based on the number of examples, ranging from ‘0’ for no cultural service example, ‘1’ for one example, ‘2’ for two examples, ‘3’ for three examples, ‘4’ for four or five examples and ‘5’ for six or more examples. For one subclass only (Education & Research ) , the number of publication records was re- scaled linearly from 0 to 5 to match the scale used for visualisation of other classes. | RESULTS
Following the framework described above, all classes of CES were identified in all countries where the assessment was conducted, with one exception where no examples were provided for the Spiritual & Religious class in France and in Ireland. A total of 237 examples of CES were collected during the course of the study (Appendix I: Table S1 ) . Across all countries (Figure 1 ) , the CES class that comprised the greatest number of examples was Cultural heritage (n = 88) with many examples of Imagery, Gastronomy and Cultural practices associated with cockles. Both Inspirational and Educational were prominent classes (n = 44 and n = 42) while Recreation & Ecotourism was fourth ( n = 28 ) , followed by Aesthetic (n = 19) and Sense of place (n = 12 ) . The CES class with the fewest examples was Spiritual & Religious with only four examples given across all five countries. In the following text, we describe the range of evidence found for each sub- class of CES, illustrating this with selected examples, and then draw out commonalities and differences among countries. All the evidence we collated is provided in Appendix I (Table S2 ) , separated by country. .1 | Cultural heritage
Cultural heritage yielded the most examples of CES linked to cockles. The largest sub- class within Cultural heritage was Imagery with 23 examples. Examples of this sub- class include the use of the word for ‘cockle’ in a wide variety of associations, including names of streets ( Figure 2a ) , race horses, restaurants and place names. In France, many streets are named after the local names for cockle such as ‘Rue du Rigadeau’ in Britanny and ‘Allée des Hénons’ in Hauts- de France. Places such as Rooghan in Counties Antrim, Galway and Mayo (Ireland) are towns believed to be named after Ruacan, the Irish name for cockle, due to local presence of a hill or mound that is cockle- shaped. Names of beaches sometimes reflect their high abundance of cockles such as ‘lagoa da Birbiricheira’ in Carnota ( Spain) and ‘Praíña dos Croques’ in San Cibrán (Spain ) . The coastal county and town name of Sligo in Ireland means ‘abounding in shells’ in Irish (Sligeah) and refers to the area's historic plenitude of shellfish, including cockles in the river and its estuary, as well as the shellfish middens common to the area. Some names are linked to people and cultural practices. In County Wexford (Ireland ) , there is a field known as the ‘cockle field’, named after the owner of the field, an old man who used to gather cockles. The small town of ‘Coquebourg’ in Normandie (France) is located closed to an old traditional cockle ( ‘coque’ in French) fishery. In Spain, the architect who built the ‘Arcade of the Glory’, in St. James Cathedral was known as ‘O home dos croques’ (= the man of the cockles) referring to his curly hair, similar to the shell of a cockle (Hodum, 2012 ) .
The second largest sub- class in Cultural heritage class was Cultural practices, with 15 examples across the five countries. There is a considerable body of evidence around small- scale commercial cockle harvesting practices across Europe documented in books, articles and photography and archive documents from museums (Figure 2b ) . For instance, in Galicia (Spain ) , the harvesting of cockles as a livelihood in coastal communities has been widely documented through photography exhibitions and video documentaries. In Portugal, the practice of cockle harvesting has become assimilated into language, as illustrated by the proverb ‘Ir a Aveiro sem sapatos’ which means going to Aveiro without shoes, referring to the historical practice of landing cockles. In Ireland, an article from the Irish Times dated 1982 described cockle- shops as a type of shop in Dublin known for serving shellfish all day long. Certain seafood including cockles and dogfish (Bia bocht) were considered ‘poor man's food’ during the Great Famine in Ireland.
The sub- class Gastronomy comprised 13 examples. A wide range of cockle recipes exists along the Atlantic from traditional , 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10252 by Universite De Bordeaux, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2022 ] .

Various recipe books showcase cockles such as ‘les coques de Cabourg’ by Eric Rolland, which provides many recipes along with description of the old tradition of cockle shellfishery in Cabourg. The distinctive shape and cultural connotations associated with cockles have also influenced sweets such as the traditional ‘Ovos Moles’ from Portugal, the sugary ‘Roudoudou’ in France as well as the famous chocolates ‘les coques de Cabourg’ in Normandy. In the past decades in Galicia ( Spain ) , the price of cockles has increased and their public image has become broader, evidenced by web articles expounding the appeal of empanadas.

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al.
Molly Malone, a folk- tale of a young fishmonger who sold cockles on the streets of Dublin, is a vivid example of traditional folklore that has persisted through generations and is now sung during Irish football matches (Figure 2d ) . A version has even been recorded by U2 and Sinead O'Connor. Some songs contain double- meanings, including popular songs in Galicia (Spain) and pop- rock music from Algarve (Portugal ) , which use the word ‘berberechiña’ in Galician or ‘Berbigão’ in Portuguese in the lyrics to mean both cockle and female genitalia. Another example of folklore was the celebration day for Santo António in Estarreja in Portugal, where competitors in parade contests dress up to illustrate local themes. Shellfish harvesting is often chosen as a theme, for example in the 2012 parade.
The sub- class Symbolic includes cockles as a symbol or emblem of identity, for example, in monuments or sculptures, or with other symbolic meanings. This sub- class comprised 10 examples. In Galicia ( Spain ) , tourist t- shirts can be purchased with the slogan ‘Beach boys: Good Berberechos’ illustrating the extent to which cockles are emblematic of the region. In Ireland, the statue of Molly Malone represents an important symbol for the city of Dublin (Figure 2d ) . On International Women's Day 2019, a Heritage Blue Plaque was unveiled in Waterford, Ireland to commemorate the Cockle Women who for generations sold cockles on the streets. Another sculpture was the ‘Mariscador’, part of the ‘Giants’ series exhibition by the Galician sculpture Francisco Leiro in Valladolid, Spain. The sculpture represents a fisherman holding a traditional ‘raño’ which is a tool used to collect clams and cockles. There were additional examples of statues of fishermen in various Spanish cities including Poio, Argoñas, Arcade and O Grove. At Morecambe Bay in the UK, the commemorative plaque ‘the Bay of Words’ is a reminder of the tragedy of the Chinese cockle harvesters who died there when overtaken by the tides while out cockling. Lastly, in the British film Casino Royale, James Bond found a cockle shell in Vesper's purse, which represented the special time shared together at the beach and a symbol of their love, as suggested by some critics (Becker et al., 2011 ) .
Language was also grouped under the Cultural heritage class since many words originated from cultural traditions. This sub- class provided eight examples. Alternatives meanings of cockles in slang and vernacular language are common in several countries. In Portuguese, the word for cockle ‘Berbigão’ has a double- meaning and is synonym for part of the female genitalia in vernacular language. After the civil war in Spain, ‘birbicheiros’ was used to refer to extremely poor people with nothing to eat but the cockles they gathered. Today, ‘berberecho’ is often used to describe ‘a very simple person’ in some part of Spain. In Cornwall, UK, cockle harvesting can also be referred as ‘trigging’ in the local dialect and this word also has sexual connotations (Carss et al., 2020 ) . Cockles have many regionally differing names in France. Although ‘la coque’ is currently the French word for cockle, it varied in the early 19th century depending on the region. For instance, in the Finistère ‘Rigadel’ was sometimes used for cockle; while in Haute- Normandie cockle was named ‘Hénon’ but ‘Bucarde’ was preferred in Basse- Normandie. Table 2 collates the many regional names for cockle in the five countries. Another evidence of using cockle in language is the proverb ‘warm the cockles of one's heart’ meaning to make one feel good. It is thought to date from the second half of 17th century and may have derived from the Latin name of the heart ventricles ‘cochleae cordis’ (Oxford University Press, 2004 ) .

Strong examples of Cultural identity associated with cockles were also provided (n = 8 ) . During the Civil War in Spain, platoons from Galicia were known as ‘Mariscos’ (= shellfish) and they had their own symbols and songs (Seixas, 2006 ) . Many historical photographs showcase women harvesting cockles. Cockle harvesting was primarily carried out by women, perhaps due to men out fishing at sea for the day. Cockle harvesting in the Welsh communities of Penclawdd gave the women a valuable source of income (Watkins, 2020 ) . As far back as 1901 in Ireland, women, often widowed or single mother and daughter, considered their principal occupation to be cockle pickers or sellers (Figure 2e ) . Cockles were also an important source of income for French women in coastal communities during the inter- war period. Another evidence of Cultural identity was the fight of fishers' guilds against intermediaries in Galicia (Spain ) , their icon was the cockle due to its high abundance along the Galician coast (Broullón Acuña, 2010 ) . A socio- economic study on the high mortality of cockles in South Wales (UK) (Murray & Tarrant, 2015 ) , identified that ‘it was readily apparent that there remains a strong cultural attachment and sense of identity associated with life- long participation in this iconic fishery in its stunning setting’. The practice of cockle picking has dramatically decreased in the UK and Ireland, and cockle picking there is more often carried out by men now. However, it remains a major livelihood for women in Galicia. The cultural linkages around cockle harvesting as an activity primarily carried out by women in Spain features strongly in the recent candidature application to World Heritage UNESCO as an essential feature of the cultural landscape for Ría de Muros and Ria de Noia, since both beaches are renowned for the harvesting of cockles by women (Figure 2f ) . A recent initiative in Spain ‘Marenfeminino’, which roughly translates as ‘the sea from the perspective of women' aimed to highlight the role of women in the sustainability of marine activities including shellfisheries. .2 | Inspirational
This class, with three sub- classes, was the second most abundant with 44 examples identified. The sub- class Art comprised the most examples (n = 20 ) . Paintings were the most expressed form of cocklerelated art with several paintings depicting cockle gatherers. The oldest form of art known so far to be associated with cockles is Cardium Pottery (Figure 3a ) , which dates from the Neolithic (6,400 BC– 5,500 BC ) . This was a decorative style of pottery from the Mediterranean region using shell impressions of the cockle (likely using two cockle species, depending on the region: C. glaucum and C. edule ) . Today, cockles remain a source of inspiration as evidenced by many paintings, photography exhibitions and films made around cockles and its association with people. Cockles are represented in sculpture form, for instance in Carlingford (Ireland; Figure 3b) or sculptures of the traditional cockle- shaped sweet in Aveiro (Portugal ) , illustrating the close links these cities share with cockles.
Many examples of cockles were found in Literature. With 15 examples, this represented the second largest sub- class within Inspirational. Famous writers have been inspired by cockles, as evidenced by numerous poems and novels referring to cockles or the activity of picking cockles in several countries (Figure 3c ) . For instance, cockles were mentioned in a poem about Carbally Hill in Waterford, Ireland from 1956. Another example is the poem ‘Os birbirichos e os Birbiricheiros’ by Xoán Manuel Pintos, roughly translated as ‘The cockles and the cockle pickers’, which paid tribute to the humble shellfish gatherers in the Ría of Arousa in Galicia (Spain ) . It has additional cultural resonance since it was part of the first book to be edited in the Galician language (A Gaita Gallega, 1853) at a time of cultural renaissance (i.e. O Rexurdimento) aiming to recover the language. Other examples include cockles mentioned in non- fiction magazines describing how to collect cockles, and featuring in a British nursery rhyme ‘Mary, Mary, Quite contrary’. [Correction added on 31 October , after first online publication: The text in section 3.2, poem name ‘Os birbirichiños e os Birbiricheiros’, author name ‘Xosé Manuel Pintos’ and translated title ‘The little cockles and the cockle pickers’ has corrected to ‘Os birbirichos e os Birbiricheiros’ by Xoán Manuel Pintos, roughly translated as ‘The cockles and the cockle pickers’. The year in the reference (A Gaita Gallega, 1953) has updated as (A Gaita Gallega, 1853 ) ].
The Advertising sub- class included nine examples. Cockles frequently feature in tourist information leaflets highlighting the key aspect of a region, such as in Ílhavo, Portugal where shellfish and cockle harvesting were mentioned as an important economic activity for the region. The activity of picking cockles and clams is advertised as part of the cultural landscape where a guidebook for walking trails in the Algarve in Portugal describes ‘During low tide you can see dozens of curved shellfish gatherers over the dark earth in search of molluscs like clams or cockles’. In Ireland, tourist brochures promote the Wild Atlantic Way with activities including cockle gathering. Other examples included promotional videos for local brands. For instance, the Spanish winery showcases the Atlantic region and its strong links with cockle harvesting through the testimony of a chef and cockle pickers. Similarly, a seafood restaurant and fishmongers hall in the UK made a short film showcasing a day in the life TA B LE 2 Variation in the names commonly used for cockle across countries and regions

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. of a cockle business, from cockle harvesting on the boat to serving cockles at their restaurant, and Victorian tourism adverts for British seaside towns often mention cockles. Another interesting manifestation of cockles in advertising can be seen in the association between a reputable Galician porcelain brand ‘Sargadelos’ and a shellfish company. They created a bowl decorated with the iconic cockle canning brand. .3 | Educational
This class included 42 examples of which History & Archaeology represented the vast majority (n = 18 ) . Evidence of cockles in History & Archaeology included examples of five archaeological research manuscripts (Figure 4a ) , seven books, three archaeological reports, one doctoral thesis and two web articles. These provided information on the use of cockles and their associated cultural significance along the Atlantic coast in history.
Education & Research was rich in evidence including scientific articles, books, meeting abstracts and reviews. From the past 30 years, the database search of ISI Web of Science showed that France contributed 243 articles, the UK 226, Spain 217, Portugal 177 and Ireland 45 articles.
Knowledge & Informal education had the lowest number of examples (n = 5 ) . Examples from France included a marine park in the Baie de Somme, where staff visit local primary schools to educate on cockle biology. Day trips are also organised with children to visit cockle beds and explain the best- practice of managing cockle beds while respecting the environment. Lectures organised by a French NGO GEMEL (Groupe d'étude des milieux estuariens et littoraux) are also available for fishermen interested in cockles. In Ireland, the Marine Institute, which also engages with primary schools through its Explorers Education Programme, has recently showcased the common cockle. An example of locally held knowledge is that cockle pickers consider it a bad omen when they observe cockle shells accumulating on the beach since it is related to high cockle mortality ( Figure 4b ) . Lastly, in Spain, the Region of Murcia produced a webpage which documents the cultural importance of cockles in Spain from the Palaeolithic to the modern age. .4 | Recreational & Ecotourism
Recreation & Ecotourism with 28 examples covered Seafood festivals ( n = 11 ) , Tourism (n = 11) and Recreational harvesting (n = 6 ) . The dominant sub- class was Seafood festivals, with festivals dedicated specifically to cockles in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the UK (Figure 5a ) . These promote cockles with tasting menus, organised cooking contests with famous chefs and innovative recipes.
The appreciation for coastal foraging has increased in the last decade, supporting a growing tourism sector, for example, with courses showing where and how to find and eat cockles in Ireland, France and the UK. A provincial council in Spain also organised routes for people to learn about the activity of the shellfish harvesters and to have the chance of a real harvesting experience. Also in Spain, a shellfish gatherers association created by women runs tourism activities focused on shellfish gathering, providing guided tours of the shore, shellfishery and cannery. Other evidence of tourism associated with cockles included tourism websites and on- line reviews of foraging courses. Cockles on the beach are sometimes so abundant that it becomes a distinctive tourism feature. For instance, Cockleshell Beach in Crookhaven, Ireland, is famous for its shells (Figure 5b ) . In the UK, the Isle of Barra is described as a good spot for picking cockles whilst Bradwell Cockle spit nature reserve is special for its 30 acres of shell bank. In Spain, the ‘Ruta del berberecho’ is a well- known hiking route along the cockle harvesting sites.
Examples for Recreational harvesting are revealed in various web articles including descriptions of the family tradition of gathering and eating cockles during summer holidays (Figure 5c ) . Other evidence included government advice and legislation governing recreational harvesting such as in the Magna Carta, which allows anyone to pick up to eight pounds of cockles in the UK for their own use without a licence. .5 | Sense of place
Sense of place comprised a single sub- class Attachment to a special place, with 12 examples provided. Memories of cockle harvesting, cooking and eating were reported across all five nations through FI G U R E 3 Inspirational examples: (a) Cardium pottery of Tajos de Cacín cave, Granada, Spain (José- Manuel Benito Álvarez (Locutus Borg ) , Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain ) ; (b) Sculpture of cockles in Carlingford ©Kate Mahony; (c) Book titled ‘Fabulas Y Leyendas de la mar’ by Alvaro Cunqueiro , 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10252 by Universite De Bordeaux, Wiley Online Library on [08/11/2022 ] .

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. several online blogs, emphasising people's strong personal connections with the coast. Similar evidence came from direct exchanges with locals who remember doing these activities as a child or seeing their grandparents collecting cockles. Buying cockles locally from a place known for cockle harvesting can also be an important cultural reference point for people. Further examples of human attachment to place were provided through anecdotal exchanges with local fishermen. .6 | Aesthetic
Only one sub- class was included in Aesthetic, namely Ornamental uses, which covered 19 examples. There were many historic as well as modern examples of cockles used as decorative features on buildings across the five countries. Examples provided included walls, a shell tower, grottoes, churches, houses and gardens covered with cockles (Figure 6a– c ) . Items of jewellery inspired by or made from cockles were given as examples in Portugal and Spain where it is very common. There were also examples of figurines or decorations made with cockle shells either as a tourist gift, Christmas decorations (Figure 6d) or as part of creative activities for children. .7 | Spiritual & Religious
Spiritual & Religious had the lowest number of examples with only four provided. Some bell pottery decorated with cockles and clam shells but also entire cockle shells were found in the megalithic remains of the Dolmen of Dombate in Galicia (Spain ) . According to archaeologists, it is believed that shells placed at the entrance of funerary monuments were used to deter wicked spirits and keep the place free of misfortune. Further evidence of likely spiritual association with cockles was the graves of San Pedro de Eume's cemetery in northern Galicia (Spain ) , which are covered with cockle, clam and scallops shells. While the original reason for this display is unknown, the local community continues to clean and replace the shells every year during All Saints Eve. In a more recent example, cockles were used to predict the future in a Portuguese TV show «A Tarde é Sua» on TVI channel in May 2020 indicating some kind of spiritual association with cockles. Lastly, a pierced cockle shell was found in the grave of the ‘Worcester pilgrim’ in the UK. While the cockle shell was sometimes represented in religious pictures (Figure 7 ) , a different species, the scallop shell is a widely recognised emblem carried by pilgrims on their way to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. Therefore this pierced cockle may have had similar symbolism to the wearer.

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. .8 | Commonalities and differences among countries
There were some commonalities across countries in that Cultural heritage consistently contained the most CES examples in every country. More obvious were the differences. For some of the classes, a number of countries provided no examples at all (Figure 8; Appendix I: Table S1 ) : CES examples of Folklore were not identified in either France or the UK. No evidence was found for Recreational harvesting in Spain and Ireland, while Informal education did not include any examples for Portugal and the UK. In Ireland, there was no evidence for Language and there were no examples of Cultural identity for Portugal. Surprisingly, France lacked any examples of Seafood festivals, Advertising, Folklore and Symbol. For the overall spread of examples, Spain had the highest number (n = 76 ) , followed by the UK (n = 45) and Portugal (n = 40 ) , France (n = 40) and lastly Ireland ( n = 36) (Figures 8 and 9 ) .
Spain dominated the examples for Cultural heritage (n = 32 ) , Inspirational (n = 18) and Recreation & Ecotourism (n = 9 ) , while Portugal provided the most evidence under the Aesthetic class (n = 8) and the UK provided the most examples for Sense of place (n = 4, Figure 8 ) .
In terms of the relative importance of sub- classes (Figure 9; Table S1 ) , for Cultural heritage classes, Spain dominated the Symbolic and Cultural sub- classes with strong evidence of cultural identity associated with cockles in Spain, which contrasted with the other countries. Spain and Ireland shared the greatest number of examples for Imagery and, with France, provided several examples of Imagery, notably streets named after cockles. Only one example was given for the UK and Portugal, perhaps due to the rudeness often associated with the alternative meanings of the word cockle. Folklore was particularly important in Portugal and Spain, but less so in Ireland. By contrast, there were no examples for the UK or France suggesting a weak influence of the cockle on British and French folklore.
For the Inspirational class, Spain dominated most examples, with France and Ireland having the fewest examples (n = 6 ) . For most of the countries, there were more examples of Art than for Literature with the exception of Portugal, which provided more examples of Literature than Art (n = 3 and n = 2, respectively; Table S1 ) .
In terms of Recreation & Ecotourism, many examples of tourism such as coastal foraging courses and guided tours were given by all nations with the exception of Portugal; suggesting that these activities might be less recognised as potential touristic activities there. Spain stood out from other nations by having a large number of examples of festivals dedicated to cockles, while the highest evidence of recreational harvesting came from the UK suggesting an enthusiasm for foraging in recent years. All countries had broadly similar scores for Tourism.
Aesthetic was led by Portugal which provided the most evidence of ornamental uses of cockle. There were only a few examples for Aesthetic provided by the UK and Ireland (n = 2) contrasting with more examples from the southern countries (Portugal: n = 8, France: n = 5 and Spain: n = 2; Figure 8 ) .
Sense of place was well- represented in the UK compared to other countries. Given that cockle harvesting has decreased in the UK, there is perhaps a kind of nostalgia around the cockle industry.

Lastly, for Educational, France had noticeably more examples of Informal education and informally expressed Knowledge than other countries. France was also the leading country in cockle research with the highest number of published research originating from authors in France, showing a strong scientific record. | DISCUSSION

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. for a deeper understanding of CES provided by cockles (Carss et al., 2020 ) . In this study, we collated evidence across five countries along the Atlantic coast on how cockles contribute to 7 classes and 19 sub- classes of cultural services. Of the main class, Cultural heritage provided the most examples followed by Inspirational; suggesting that these classes are important and should receive more attention in studies on CES. We also found strong differences between countries, both in the numbers of examples, and the distribution of examples among sub- classes.
The predominance of Cultural heritage examples makes sense, given the high dependency of many coastal communities on natural systems for their livelihood. Traditional rural communities such as in Galicia (Spain) often share longstanding associations with particular ecosystems and the associated features are inherent to their cultural identity (Comberti et al., 2015 ) . As such, for many cockle gatherers, harvesting goes far beyond the activity of collecting cockles and is part of a way of life in a similar fashion to fisheries (Brookfield et al., 2005; Urquhart et al., 2014; van Ginkel, 2001 ) .
Our study also draws attention to differences in cultural services provided by cockles among countries along the Atlantic coast. Culture plays a crucial role in defining nature's contributions to people (Díaz et al., 2018) and given that Cultural heritage is tightly linked with history and human experiences (Daniel et al., 2012 ) , differences in Cultural heritage among countries are perhaps to be expected. As such, the CES examples which were collated over five culturally and socio- economically different countries translate into important differences in the way nature's contribution to people can be experienced. For instance, Spain provided rich Cultural heritage examples with a strong evidence of Cultural identity, Folklore and Symbol associated with cockles. One surprise was the extent to which cultural heritage and other CES differed between Spain and Portugal, neighbouring countries which both have a strong maritime heritage. Divergences in tradition and symbolic values have been found between other fishing nations, for example, between Finland and Estonia in relation to salmon fishing in the Baltic (Ignatius et al., 2019 ) . Similarly, beaches in rural Ireland and Portugal were also perceived and valued differently ( MacLeod et al., 2002 ) , although in this case the differences in cultural and climatic settings may contribute substantially to this situation.
One less tangible aspect of inter- country differences is the extent to which cultural references are grounded in the present or in the past. In the northern countries of our study, UK and Ireland, cockle gathering is now less of a community activity and the strong coastal connections with cockles tend to exist more in the past than the present. By contrast, in the southern countries of our study, particularly Spain and Portugal but also to a lesser extent France, traditional cockle harvesting is still ongoing and embedded within its coastal communities. Traditions are passed along from one generation to the other and folklore surrounding cockles is maintained. The differences in the CES examples given by each nation support the point that cultural, political- economic and social dynamics influence CES over time (Gould et al., 2020 ) .
Evaluation of CES classes in the ES literature are often directed towards Recreation & Ecotourism with little attention given to other CES, and studies which evaluate more than five CES are very rare (Cheng et al., 2019 ) . Here, we produced data on 19 sub- classes of CES, allowing us to focus in more detail on how representation of these cultural elements differs among countries, and particularly those aspects of a more intangible nature (Chan, Guerry, et al., 2012; Milcu et al., 2013 ) . Many cultural services provide indirect benefit to humans but are generally hard to identify and are therefore often disregarded from assessments, leading to a risk of excluding important cultural values in policy- making ( Chan, Guerry, et al., 2012; Fletcher et al., 2014; Laband, 2013 ) . Among the extensive suite of CES identified in our study, many examples belonged to Inspirational, which is generally the least investigated class in other studies (Hernández- Morcillo et al., 2013 ) . This confirms its importance to humans and that it forms a larger part of cultural services than previously suggested. A strong place- based identity also emerges clearly from these examples, despite few concrete examples in this sub- class. Examples which were more simply categorised into other sub- classes allude to this place- based identity. These include the wide variation of local names for cockle which have a strong regional focus, the ‘Mariscos’ name (meaning shellfish) for the Spanish platoons from Galicia in the Civil War, and imagery used in advertising to trigger feelings of affinity with the coast and personal memories of previous coastal visits. Thus, cockles support a strong place- specific identity which, like in other areas, is built up around the history, heritage and culture associated with the region (Ma & Lew, 2012 ) .
The structured approach using an a priori framework had a number of advantages. Firstly, it allowed us to provide guidance, and clear examples, to stakeholders when eliciting responses during the evidence gathering, which can help reduce biases (Cheng et al., 2019; Hernández- Morcillo et al., 2013 ) . It also served as an aid to classification of examples (Cheng et al., 2019; Hernández- Morcillo et al., 2013 ) . The use of a structured approach encourages consideration of every class of CES, increasing the representation of less conspicuous CES. Lastly, the structured classes facilitate comparisons among countries, or groups of participants. Despite the lack of maps and situational questions used by Gould et al. (2015) to elicit CES, our a- priori framework and the additional benefits of the deliberative process prompted many examples of CES.
In particular, the deliberative approach through group activities among stakeholders with a wide range of knowledge and expertise allowed participants to exchange ideas and stimulate new lines of thinking in a more reactive way, guided by the facilitator. Confidence in outcomes from deliberated group activity is generally higher than from individuals who have not participated in a deliberative process (Kenter, Jobstvogt, et al., 2016 ) . Deliberated groups provide more opportunities for diverse voices to be heard with often different perspectives and interests (Elstub, 2010; Kenter, Bryce, et al., 2016 ) . In our study the focus was on stimulating creative thinking and developing a shared understanding of the task, rather than adopting positions on an issue, and the deliberative process helped achieve this. Deliberative process are increasingly recognised as a valuable approach in the evaluation of ecosystem services (Kenter, Bryce, et al., 2016) as ecosystem assessment requires consideration of shared values (Fish et al., 2011 ) .

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. place- based and indigenous values like cultural identity, spiritual and heritage, are often overlooked in ecosystem assessment (Pascua et al., 2017 ) , and in our study, this provided a mechanism to gather this information. Given the shared understanding of the task, and the longer duration follow- on work which allowed participants time to gather further examples, we can be reasonably confident that the differences observed between countries are likely to reflect reality rather than being a result of sampling effort or inherent bias in participant selection. However, differences in the background knowledge or the degree of engagement of the participants may still lead to some influence on the outcomes. Another potential disadvantage of deliberative methods can be the power dynamics, both with respect to those invited to participate and through the dynamics of the process. The deliberative process may not adequately neutralise or may even exaggerate the unequal distribution of power amongst participants (Williams, 2000; Young, 1996 ) . However, if conducted sensitively, deliberative processes can also help marginalised groups to get their voice heard and thus help address inequalities, and be a positive and creative energy in collective thinking (Hendriks, 2009 ) .
As a minor disadvantage of this approach, the large number of CES classes compared with the number of groups in the comparison (i.e. five countries) precluded any multi- variate analysis of differences among respondents. Separate surveys of individuals would have provided greater flexibility in quantitative analysis, but would have lost the balanced participatory approach, and lost the shared values, richness and stimulation that comes with discussion in a group context. By counting the number of CES examples given in each sub- class, aggregating into class and ranking them, we were able to compare CES that are difficult to quantify in economic terms ( Daniel et al., 2012 ) . Overall, the methodological approach used in this study starts to address some of the challenges faced in assessing CES in a systematic way (Cheng et al., 2019 ) .
Setting up the a priori framework required some iteration after testing with pilot data. This revealed some challenges in assessing CES where an example could be assigned to more than one class, which can lead to difficulties in interpretation (Hernández- Morcillo et al., 2013 ) . Sculptures, for instance, could be interpreted as Art but also Symbolic if they hold significant meaning which itself may be linked to Folklore or Cultural identity. Other examples with potential ambiguity in the classification included the folk song about Molly Malone. In this study, the song was classified under Folklore since it is associated with cockle harvesting tradition. However, it could also have been placed under Cultural identity or Symbolic since it has become a cultural symbol of Irish people, and is sung during football matches. Another category which provided challenges in classification was advertising. Here, advertising was placed in Inspirational as we believe advertising draws on natural and cultural features as a source of inspiration. It could also however be used as evidence of tourism when promoting an activity. While the sub- class Gastronomy is hard to uniquely assign, we grouped these examples under Cultural heritage since recipes have a strong traditional and historical basis with regional ties, and which are passed on from one generation to the next. These examples illustrate that it can be difficult to isolate particular CES as many of the classes are inter- related, either by originating from a common theme, or building on one another ( Gould et al., 2020 ) . Another reason for this is that multiple types of meaning and value may be present in many of these instances. As long as allocation to classes was consistently applied across the study, and the assumptions were stated, this was not deemed to be a problem, and we recognise that other studies may take different allocation decisions.
Associations between ecosystem services are common and the idea of ecosystem service ‘bundles’ has currency in the literature ( Ament et al., 2017; Bennett et al., 2009; Cumming & Peterson, 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2017 ) . One ecosystem may provide several services ( = co- provisioning) or some services may require another (= codependence) (Ament et al., 2017; Bennett et al., 2009 ) . Such synergies are also common among CES bundles (Lee & Lautenbach, 2016 ) . For instance, locations of recreational activities are often valuable due to a combination of their aesthetic nature, cultural heritage and identity (Chan et al., 2012; Daniel et al., 2012; Rodrigues et al., 2017 ) . By engaging with food and food- related activities in festivals, tourists experience the culture and identity of the food- producing region with increased awareness of the associated community (Lee & Arcodia, 2011; Rusher, 2003 ) . Similarly, a rich cultural heritage is likely to significantly affect local artistic creativity through its aesthetical and emotional value, and to have influenced inspiration through time (Cerisola, 2019 ) , and our findings bear this out. In Spain for example, cockles appeared to be a substantial source of inspiration with a large selection of examples for ancient and modern art, advertising and literature. Within the same class of Cultural heritage, areas with a stronger heritage are likely to have more examples across more sub- classes where this is manifested, for example in slang, street names, folklore and symbols of cultural identity.
Lastly, we recognise that the focus of our study is on a single species. This has some implications for interpretation of the findings, and is an interesting comparator with ecosystem- based studies. Like oysters, which are well- documented providers of ecosystem benefits ( Michaelis et al., 2020 ) , cockles are often the dominant entity or ‘keystone’ of the coastal ecosystem in which they live. However, some of the cultural values associated with it are not limited to the organism but occur through wider associations. For example shellfish, including cockles, was the symbol of the movement ‘Mariscos’ in Spain, and some of the valued features such as cockle beaches are dependent on cockles within a wider landscape setting. Analysis for a single species also precludes consideration of many tradeoffs. However, by building up the information about multiple species or components of an ecosystem, this allows a stronger more informed quantification and discussion of the tradeoffs inherent in managing a particular ecosystem, compared with, for example, more simplistic assessments which involve converting one ecosystem type to another (Geange et al., 2019 ) . | CONCLUSION
With this study, we demonstrate that information on a diverse suite of CES can be collated and quantified, using a methodology that can be applied to other types of ecosystems and species.

JACKSON- BUÉ et Al. comprehensively describe the CES provided by cockles and compare differences among countries from Europe's Atlantic coast. It was clear that cockles provide important CES across all countries given the rich and diverse examples across all CES classes. We identified associations among CES that differed among countries, such as strong evidence of Cultural identity and practices, Folklore and Symbol associated with cockles in Spain, which contrasted with the notable evidence of Ornamental value of cockles in Portugal. In assessing CES gained by cockles using an a priori framework during a series of workshop and virtual meetings, our study demonstrated the importance of CES in coastal areas and reflected the context dependent cultural values of cockles to humans. With ever increasing anthropogenic pressures, it is critical to find ways to integrate cultural practices into solutions for the management of ecosystems and thus improve ecosystem quality, coastal biodiversity and human well- being. CES can serve as a gateway for engaging the public with issues around cockle management and enhancing the ecosystems which support cockles (Cabana et al., 2020 ) . As a result, understanding these relationships can help to design and implement sustainable management approaches for these ecosystems, supported by deeper local engagement (Bennett et al., 2009 ) .

Handling Editor: Sarah Crowley Abstract . Few empirical studies have described social- ecological systems (SESs) in transition. Some studies focused on external drivers that impact the SES and communities' responses to adapt to changes, including economic, land and conservation policies. Others have considered the effect of social and cultural changes on communities' capacity to sustain their activities. While sociocultural changes are increasingly common through globalization and world- wide economic development, there is an urgent need to better understand and document how these changes affect individual and community agency to adapt or transform a system that is facing a combination of powerful internal and external forces. . The human– Asian elephant relationship appears particularly illustrative of a complex SES because of the dual status of the elephant being wild or under human care, and the entanglement of ecological, cultural, social and economic dimensions. The ongoing and rapid political, socio- economic and environmental changes occurring in Laos for the last decades have strongly affected this relationship. . We conducted an ethnological survey to assess how the SES has evolved in Laos and its consequences for human- wild- captive elephant interactions and elephant handling practices. We show that in the 1990s, the SES was based on the principles of common access to natural resources and social control over nature and spirits, and led to a form of elephant handling with close interactions between captive and wild elephants. Husbandry practices then could be likened to pastoralism as a mode of production associated with a mode of relation close to seasonal freedom. . Since the turn of the present century, the commodification of nature and of increasingly divided access to natural resources led eventually to the segregation of wild elephants and captivity of their working conspecifics. With the intensification of workload, owners switched to a ranching- like economy, based on the accumulation of monetary capital from the employment of elephants in logging or tourism. | People and Nature
MAURER Et Al. | INTRODUCTION
Various conceptual approaches have been developed to understand and analyse the processes of transition or transformation in society (Patterson et al., 2017 ) . Among them, social- ecological systems ( SESs) are complex and integrated systems in which humans are part of nature (Berkes & Folke, 1998 ) . SESs are dynamic, and changes occur across multiple scales in time, space and organizational levels ( Gunderson & Holling, 2002; Liu et al., 2015 ) . In addition, people and their environment interact reciprocally and form complex feedback loops (Liu et al., 2007 ) . In this context, there is a need to study how periods of gradual change interact with abrupt changes, and how human groups are able to adapt or even transform into new development pathways in the face of dynamic change (Folke, 2016 ) . While adaptation refers to the capacity of social actors to learn, combine experience and knowledge and adjust social behaviour to pertain the SES fundamental structure and functions, transformation in contrast refers to a larger intentional change that creates a fundamentally different system when ecological, economic or social structures make the existing system unsustainable (Folke, 2016 ) . Adaptation and transformation are intimately linked within SES; adaptation at one level may lead to a transformation at another level (Pelling & Manuel- Navarrete, 2011 ) .
A growing number of empirical studies have described SES in transition. Early work on SES regime shifts focused on their ecological components (Armitage et al., 2012 ) . Further studies identified the external drivers that impact the SES and the response of communities, including climate change, economic and political regime shifts ( Forbes et al., 2009; Ramprasad et al., 2020; Zanotti et al., 2020 ) . However, few empirical studies have considered the effect of social and cultural changes, which are increasingly common through globalization and world- wide economic development, on the agency of individuals and communities to pertain their traditions and activities. For example, co- management initiatives, women and local communities' empowerment have been advocated to foster the internal response of communities to maintain sustainable and healthy SES ( Eriksson et al., 2021; Fedele et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2014 ) . Local social and cultural practices also support adaptive and transformative change in the face of changing internal and external forces (Apgar et al., 2015; Senos et al., 2006 ) . However, at the individual level, actors at the centre of the system may be pulled away by the dynamics of change towards other livelihoods that are either less difficult, more culturally appropriate in a changing society or more remunerative (Ramprasad et al., 2020; White, 2015 ) . For example, the social status of emerging livelihoods and the intergenerational erosion of interest in artisanal fishing led to an ageing population of fishers and difficulties to recruit young ones (Tam et al., 2018 ) .
In a rapidly changing world on both the natural and social sides, there is an urgent need to better understand and document how social and cultural changes affect individual and community agency to adapt or transform a system that is facing a combination of powerful internal and external forces. In this context, we use the case of the human- captive and wild elephant relationship in Laos to shed light on the ongoing changes occurring in this particular SES under both external and internal drivers that are illustrative of a wider situation prevailing world- wide.
The human– Asian elephant relationship is akin to a SES because of the dual status of the elephant being wild or under human care, and the entanglement of ecological, cultural, symbolic, social, economic, emotional and inter- subjective dimensions. Elephants have been trained and used by humans for at least 4,000 years as war animals, mounts of kings or draught animals for transport and forestry ( Trautmann, 2015 ) . The capture of wild elephants to supplement the captive population has maintained demographic and genetic links between these two populations until the 1970s (Sukumar, 2011 ) . These links persist to date, particularly through the reproduction of captive females with wild males (Maurer et al., 2017 ) . The plummeting number of Asian elephants is of global concern. From an ecological point of view, the viability of wild and captive elephant populations is threatened by habitat reduction, poaching and capture, increasing conflicts with local human communities and low birth rates (Choudhury et al., 2008 ) . From the humanities point of view, the long- lasting relationship between humans and Asian elephants has been affected by many changes, among others the major social and economic changes occurring recently in range of countries, loss of traditional knowledge, new elephant working practice, and the raising of new actors like welfare and conservation organizations (Locke & Buckingham, 2016 ) . . We discuss how the combination of external drivers, such as economic liberalization, land and conservation policies, and internal drivers linked to sociocultural changes could affect a SES in transition, leading to a fading interest of the new generation in their family heritage.

MAURER Et Al.
The SES approach provides a novel and relevant framework for analysing the dynamics of the human- wild- captive elephant system in Laos. Indeed, wild and captive elephants are closely interlinked within the landscape. The disciplinary roots of SES are in ecology, but the approach has been broadened by inclusion of the social sciences (Patterson et al., 2017 ) . Therefore, the SES approach provides a framework suited to the abrupt social, ecological and economic changes that have occurred in Laos over the past few decades.
Through this study, we aim to provide an empirical description of a SES in transition under the influence of powerful external drivers, from economic liberalization to land and conservation policies. We also strive to shed light on the impact cultural and social changes have had on this relationship, leading to a fading interest of the new generation in their family heritage. We believe our case study is illustrative of a wider prevalent situation faced by SES in transition due to globalized economic, social and cultural changes.
We focus specifically on describing the changes in perceptions and practices among Lao elephant owners and mahouts who are at the heart of the human- captive- wild elephant relation using a combination of SES and anthropological approaches based on semi- structured interviews. Acknowledging the prominence of symbolic, historical and intimate dimensions of the relationships, we aim to provide a new insight, using a more systemic approach linking ecological, social, cultural and economic components of the system.
To do so, we first describe the SES that prevailed 20– 30 years ago, which was based on the principles of common access to natural resources and social control over nature and spirits. Some anthropological materials collected during the study allow us to highlight the importance of values and symbolism of the species. Secondly, we enquire how, since the opening of the country to the market economy, the rise to dominance of nature commodification and the partitioning of natural resources led to major changes in the SES. Thirdly, we analyse the impacts these changes have had on the elephant handling system using a four- dimensions model based on ( a) specific modes of production and (b) taskscape in the sense of Ingold (1974, 2000 ) , (c) the modes of relation between humans and animals following Stépanoff's (2017) categorization and (d) the landscape. Finally, we discuss how the combination of external drivers, such as economic liberalization, as well as land and conservation policies, and internal drivers linked to cultural and social changes has impacted this relationship, leading to a fading interest of the new generation in their family heritage. | SUPPORTING CONCEPTS AND THEORIES
For more clarity, we define in this section several concepts and theories that are mobilized throughout our analysis and discussion. We first introduce some key external drivers of the SES: neoliberalism, commodification of nature and land management policies. Then we present supporting concepts, inspired from studies on pastoralism, that offer comparative categorizations to build a conceptual model of the human– elephant handling system. .1 | External drivers: Neoliberalism, commodification of nature and land management policies
Harvey (2005) defined neoliberalism as the theory of politicaleconomic practices that proposes that human well- being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial skills with an institutional framework characterized by strong property rights, free markets and free trade. Neoliberalization includes politicaleconomic practices such as expansion of market valuation to spheres that were formerly unaffected by commerce such as protected forests and ecosystem services (Gómez- Baggethun & Ruiz- Pérez, 2011; Robertson, 2006 ) . Assigning prices and values to natural commodities and allowing their trading within a free market has been called the commodification of natural resources (Liverman, 2004; Robertson, 2006 ) . Concomitantly, government policies promote the partitioning, regulation and even privatization of access to natural resources that had previously been managed as commons ( Ingold, 1980 ) . These landscape- dividing policies tend to control and often exclude local people, generating misunderstandings, oppositions or even conflicts with cultural values and the needs of local communities (Brockington & Igoe, 2006; Chan et al., 2007; Infield et al., 2017 ) . Therefore, institutions, policies and information brokers ( NGOs, media, researchers) can ultimately affect the relationship between humans and nature (Campbell, 2005; Cumming, 2016; Linnell et al., 2015 ) .
Beginning in the late 1980s, governments in south- east Asia and international institutions undertook major political- economic changes and shifts in line with neoliberalism (Nevins & Peluso, 2018 ) . Changes in land- use patterns, deforestation and loss of biodiversity are among the main drivers of changes in tropical ecosystems (Fisher et al., 2011; Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011 ) . Since the 1980s, land conversion for agriculture and pasture has replaced or degraded tropical forests and grasslands (Gibbs et al., 2010 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated the importance for large mammals of retaining native habitat within agricultural land (Ferreira et al., 2018; Galán- Acedo et al., 2019 ) . Depending on the structure and configuration of the matrix (agroforestry, polyculture or monoculture ) , human- modified landscapes provide functional diversity for wildlife foraging, dispersal and reproduction (Ferreira et al., 2018 ) . .2 | Linking social and ecological relations in a conceptual model: Production, Taskscape, TEK and landscape
Using the example of arctic reindeer herders, Ingold (1974) emphasized the relationships between the system of ecological relations linking the human population with herds and pastures, and | People and Nature
MAURER Et Al. the system of human social relations governing access to the land and to animals. The landscape arises alongside what Ingold (2000) called the taskscape, or the entire ensemble of tasks done by humans in the environment, where tasks are the constitutive acts of dwelling. The tasks include technical and social activities and their mutual interlocking. The concept of taskscape encompasses traditional ecological knowledge (TEK ) . TEK refers to the place- based knowledge that is rooted in local cultures and generally associated with long- settled communities that have strong ties to their natural environments (Antweiler, 1998; Orlove et al., 2010; Sillitoe, 1998 ) . According to Berkes (2008 ) , TEK is the understanding of ecological relationships and systems of managing resources by communities. A resource management system includes an appropriate set of practices, tools and techniques. TEK also includes social attitudes, beliefs and conventions of behaviour.
Based on the human– reindeer system, Ingold (1974) described the conditions driving the changes from a hunting economy to pastoralism and ranching. Ingold's description of hunting, pastoralism and ranching economies refers to different modes of production. The pastoralism mode of production is based on a common access to pasture with an exclusive right of disposal of the owner over his animals and progeny. While in pastoralism owners aim to increase their animal stock through natural reproduction, in a ranching economy owners intend to accumulate monetary capital. Recent research on pastoralism shows that the conventional relation of protective domination in which humans drive, protect and feed their livestock should indeed be characterized according to different levels of animal autonomy, leading to five different modes of relations ranging from seasonal freedom to captivity (Stépanoff et al., 2017 ) . Because local practices that constitute the taskscape impact the landscape in return, the landscape is perpetually under construction (Ingold, 2000 ) . | MATERIALS AND METHODS .1 | Study area and species
Laos is a mountainous tropical country located in the Indochinese peninsula. Of its total population, 83% live in rural areas at low densities (Ducourtieux et al., 2005 ) .
Since the revolution in 1975, Lao People's Democratic Republic, or Laos, is ruled under the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. With the end of Soviet aid after 1990, the political framework changed radically with the opening of the country to the market economy and economic liberalization. Within a few years, the regime turned to international assistance, undertook structural reforms of its economy and institutions, particularly financial institutions, and gradually opened up to foreign capital and tourists (Evrard & Pholséma, 1997 ) . Land reform, and more precisely the individualization of land rights and the systematic zoning and mapping of forests, became a precondition for agricultural intensification (Ducourtieux et al., 2005 ) . Concurrently, forest cover declined from 70% of land cover in the 1940s to 41.5% in 2005, with an acceleration since the 1990s ( Robichaud et al., 2009 ) . The main direct drivers of deforestation are the expansion of agriculture— both by individual farmers and by large agribusinesses— and the development of industrial tree plantations and large hydropower, mining and infrastructure projects ( Lestrelin, 2010; Ramcilovic- Suominen & Kotilainen, 2020 ) . Shifting cultivation and selective logging are blamed by the government and International NGO for degrading forests, but many scholars dispute this claim (Castella et al., 2013; Lestrelin, 2010; RamcilovicSuominen & Kotilainen, 2020 ) . Access to land and natural resources by foreign investors, referred to as ‘land grabbing’, and neoliberal and extraterritorial modes of governance have driven agrarian transformation and impacted community livelihoods (Baird & Barney, 2017; Schoenberger et al., 2017 ) . The development of agro- plantations, the reduction of shifting cultivation and the privatization of land have affected the dwellings of both wild and captive elephants.
Laos, historically known as Lan Xang, the ‘Land of a million elephants’, shelters both wild and captive elephants with high levels of interactions between the two populations (Maurer et al., 2017 ) . In Lao language, captive elephants (Xang ban) are literally called ‘village elephants’ where ‘ban’ means village or home. In this paper, we choose to adopt emic interpretations that reflect the cognitive and linguistic categories of the natives, as opposed to etic interpretations that are developed by the researcher for purposes of analysis ( Harris, 1976 ) . Therefore, we adopt the Lao terminology of ‘village elephants’ instead of ‘domestic elephants’ or ‘captive elephants’ that is used in biology. Wild elephants are called ‘Xang pa’ where ‘pa’ means forest. Wild and forest being the same word in Lao language, we use the terminology of wild elephants in this article. In Laos, the interpretation of wild and forest is historically illustrated by the opposition between the muang (district or city) and the pa (forest ) , a dialectical contrast rather than a strict dichotomy between domestic, civilized settlements and the wild, untamed forests (Singh, 2009 ) . The pa is a place of backwardness that lacks social order, but is also a source of desired natural resources. The muang– pa dialectic interlinks natural and social worlds emphasizing the social process of the domestication of the wild pa into the civilized muang. The perception of the forest, and of wild and village elephants, has shaped the relationships between the species, their owners and their caretakers, who are called ‘mahouts’.
Up until the end of the 20th century, Laos sheltered large populations of wild and village elephants sharing the same habitat, with ,000 and 850 individuals respectively (Santiapillai, 1993 ) . In 2010, the wild population numbers from 600 to 800 individuals, living mostly in isolated and fragmented forest areas (Khounboline, 2011 ) . Village elephants are privately owned in Laos. Most village elephants belong to owners from the Sayaboury province (Maurer, 2018 ) . Ownership is shared by 3.6 people on average, usually from the same family (Suter et al., 2013 ) . Time- sharing is the most common arrangement among co- owners. Both working duties and profits are shared according to their agreement (Maurer, 2018 ) . During the s, at the time of the country's opening, families often handled a herd of several (up to 10) elephants (Maurer, 2018 ) . Owners were in charge of caring and working with their elephant. In such cases, the | 5

MAURER Et Al. owner was also a mahout. A minority of owners employed mahouts and did not perform husbandry tasks. For clarity, we use the word ‘mahout’ for employees who do not own the elephant. .2 | Data collection
The study is based on long- term work (15 years) of the first author with elephant owners and mahouts’ communities completed in 2015 by 5 weeks of ethnographic survey focused on semi- structured interviews to explore (a) owners' and mahouts' knowledge and perception of the species, (b) handling practices, (c) interactions between wild and captive elephants and (4) the future of mahoutship and elephants in the country (see interview guide in Table S1 ) . Additional questions and topics were addressed in the course of the discussion of specific points of interests or because of the respondent's willingness to talk about a particular subject. Questions were adapted, and some topics were not addressed for respondents who did not own an elephant, such as officials, monks, retired owners or training masters. Some questions or subtopics were not addressed with some respondents because of lack of time or misunderstanding, or reluctance of the respondent to answer. This method was chosen to allow respondents to provide a broad range of answers on complex issues such as their perceptions and practices, with as little influence as possible from the investigator (Huntington, 2000 ) .
Interviews typically lasted for 30 min or more and were usually conducted in the field, next to the elephant's resting place. Sampling was done using a stratified method based firstly on the district of residence, as it appears from the first author's experience that handling practices may show spatial variation. The first author conducted a total of 52 interviews. In the Sayaboury province, he interviewed 13 respondents from Thongmixay district, 11 from Paklay and Phieng, 11 from Hongsa and nine from Ngeun district (Figure 1 ) . He also conducted six interviews in Pathoumphone district in the southern province of Champassak. This district hosts 20 elephants, but sheltered more than a hundred village elephants at the end of the 20th century. Secondly, sampling was stratified according to the respondent's status to capture potential variation in their answers. We prioritized elephant owners over mahouts, as they are predominant in making strategic decisions regarding the management system. The first author interviewed elephant owners (40 ) , mahouts ( eight ) , officials (two) from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at national level and from Sayaboury province and one monk living in a village known for its elephant- keeping tradition. Because elephant handling is mostly a male activity, we had only one female respondent who co- owns an elephant with her brothers. Respondents were of various ethnic origins (Taï Lao, Taï Dam, Taï Leu, Khamou and Hmong ) . Interviews were conducted in Lao language by the first author, recorded on a Zoom H1 handy recorder, and fully translated into French and English.
In the absence of an ethics committee incharge of anthropological studies at Montpellier University at the time of the study, all methods were carried out in accordance with the legal requirements and guidelines for anthropological surveys from the institutional protocols for research of the National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS) (Baude et al., 2006 ) . All informants provided informed verbal consent before participating in the interview. Only respondent first name was asked. Answers were anonymized during analyses. | RESULTS AND ANALYSIS .1 | Principles guiding the SES in the 1990s: Common access to natural resources and social control over spirits
Human– elephant relations in the 1990s describe a SES based on two main principles— a common access to natural resources and the social control over nature and spirits. The period of the 1990s, at the time of the country's opening, was expressed by the interviewer with phrases such as: ‘in the nineties’, ‘some 20– 30 years ago’ or ‘when your father and grandfather carried out this activity’, depending on the age of the respondent.
Elephants were formerly part of the family heritage (Xang moladok khopkwa ) . They were released most of the time and lived in small herds from owners of the same family or from the village. Village elephants were not feed with cultivated fodder but foraged in the forest or bush surrounding the village. Mahouts visited them once a month. Elephants were either completely free (poy ) , or partially restricted with hobbles (catyae) on the front legs or a chain (sow) that the elephant dragged. The choice of the mode of restraint depended on the animal's behaviour and on the distance to crops. Males and ‘naughty’ elephants were usually restrained with hobbles to avoid their escape, attacks on humans or crop raiding. Such an extensive mode of handling was possible because large forest areas and fallow lands were available where elephants could browse freely and sustain themselves. Elephants were used for occasional domestic work and raised at little or no cost thanks to their free- ranging abilities and free reproduction with their village conspecifics, or through crossmating with wild males.
The close relationship between elephants and humans is very much alive in some areas of Laos, such as Sayaboury province, and the perception of the species by mahouts and elephant owners is rooted in a long history and tradition of coexistence between humans and elephants.
Lao people distinguish wild (forest) elephants (Xang pa) from their captive (village) conspecifics (Xang ban ) , but 71% of respondents considered that village and wild elephants were the same species ( sanît: kind, sort or species when related to animals ) . Interestingly, the further away respondents live from areas where wild elephants currently occur, the more they considered village and wild elephants as different species. When we asked what these differences were, we noticed 24 answers referring to physical attributes with no clear consensus, such as the head and/or the ear being either bigger or smaller. Otherwise, 20 answers were related to coexistence with humans (wild do not live with humans, wild do not work, wild do not | People and Nature
MAURER Et Al. have scars, etc.) and 19 answers concerned behavioural differences ( wild elephants attack or run away in the presence of humans ) .
Two elephant owners from Hongsa and Thongmixay referred to a Lao tale about the origin of wild elephants:
In ancient times there were only village elephants. An elephant was born and could not be caught. He fled into the forest. […] This elephant remained free for three months and could not be caught. He became a wild elephant […] and bred in the forest. […] So, we captured some wild elephants, brought them back and raised them. They know the language like our elephants. (#44, Hongsa)
This popular cosmogony illustrates the dualist view between the civilized world, where humans were sent with their domestic companions, and the forest or wilderness that shelters afterwards some fugitives. More specifically, these stories illustrate the paths between the village (ban) and the wild or the forest (pa ) . Elephant owners do not conceive of either ‘village’ or ‘wild’ as an immutable status. Among answers, 13 indicated that wild elephants can become village elephants after capture and training, with the exception of big or aggressive elephants that cannot be easily captured and tamed. Seven respondents also added that a wild elephant needed to be released from its wild spirits to become a village one.
Actually, an individual elephant's status is not inherited from its progenitors. Indeed, even if the owner of a female elephant can claim ownership of its progeny, the calf is considered a village elephant only from the moment it is trained and lives with humans, whether its father is a wild or a village elephant. Finally, the taming of a village- born elephant appears to be a mix of breaking- in techniques and rituals aimed at clearing the elephant from its wild spirits:
A calf that hasn't been taught yet doesn't belong to us. It still belongs to the forest… It is wild. The spirits of the forest (phi pa) are not those of the village (phi ban ) . If the shaman doesn't hit hard enough to scare them away, the elephant dies. […] Once the shaman FI G U R E 1 Distribution of wild and village elephant populations in Lao PDR and surveyed areas.

MAURER Et Al. has taken care of the spirits, it's okay, it's a village elephant. (# 35, Hongsa)
After its taming, the village calf seeks the protection of the spirits of the house (phi heuan) such as the owner's family (Lainé, 2018a ) . The domestic status is transient and the path to domestication is reversible. Indeed, 11 respondents confirmed known cases of village elephants returning back to the wild. Decades ago, village elephants were released in the forest over long periods of time and could meet with wild ones. It was not uncommon for them to escape and follow their wild congeners, especially gestating females. The latest known case of a village elephant never retrieved was 5 years ago. For eight respondents, such escaped village elephants become fully wild and forget the language of humans, whereas six respondents considered that they still remember the language. Two respondents also noticed that their wild spirits came back. The ownership that is transmitted from the mother to its calf is therefore only prerequisite for an elephant to be considered as a village one. The status of forest or village elephant is eventually a question of perpetuating the control over spirits. Elephant masters are engaged in a perpetual attempt to harness and control the wild nature of their elephants, which illustrates the dialectic between the wild and the domestic, between untamed natural resources and village prosperity described by Singh ( 2012 ) .
According to our analysis, by the end of the 20th century, the interactions between elephant owners, wild and village elephants were based on the principles of cohabitation, habitat and resources being shared, with an attempt by the community to control the resources (Figure 2 ) . .2 | A new state of the SES based on commodification and divided access to natural resources
The two last decades have seen major changes in these ecological and socio- economic factors.
Since the 1990s and the opening of the country to the market economy, Laos has been engaged in a major social, economic and ecological transition under a process of neoliberalization. These changes have induced a major shift in the foundational paradigm of human– elephant relationships and strongly impacted village elephant husbandry practices, as well as management and perception of wild elephants, as detailed hereafter (Figure 3 ) .
The development of timber quotas during the first decade of the st century motivated some people to invest in an elephant. Nine respondents indicated that they bought their elephant with the intention of working for the logging industry:
There used to be a lot of timber quotas and you could quickly earn money. That's why I bought an elephant, besides there's not much expenses [to handle an elephant ] . (#27, Paklay)
Six respondents even sold and bought several animals, changing radically the status of the elephant from a full member of the family to a production investment. Thereupon, elephants were priced on a market basis depending on variations in supply and demand (Maurer et al., 2017 ) .
Since the 1990s, the development of the forestry industry for export has disrupted elephant handling practices. From being employed in occasional village work, elephants became beasts of burden employed full- time by the timber industry. Their workload slightly increased during the last two decades until the recent decrease in timber quotas instituted by the government, which left many elephants jobless. Thirteen respondents confirmed that their workload decreased during the last 2 years before our study. Most elephants now perform a variety of tasks, depending on opportunities and periods of the year (Table 1 ) .
Some village elephants have been reconverted in the tourism industry, especially around Luang Prabang, a UNESCO heritage city, located far from their native region. However, tourism does not have the capacity to employ all village elephants. Approximately elephants are employed by the tourism sector, some of them temporarily, as tourism is a seasonal activity. Private companies also buy village elephants to operate their businesses, turning a family heritage into a means of production. Nowadays, owners who do not make an income from their elephant workforce consider selling, exporting or renting them to foreign countries for tourism or circus purposes:

MAURER Et Al.
Right now my elephant is in China. I hired a young man from the village to take care of it and I visit them every three months. In Hongsa, there are 11 elephants that left together. (#41, Hongsa)
The process of commodification has also strongly impacted breeding practices. The long gestation of females and the long period before calves are weaned are not compatible with an intensive workload. Therefore, owners of female elephants have to make an economic choice between selling their calf after weaning or earning an alternative income from logging during the 3- year gestation and weaning period (Maurer et al., 2017 ) . During the last two decades, most owners have preferred the incomes generated by their elephant work, resulting in a drastic decrease in the village elephant population. However, the constant rise in elephant prices has recently led a growing number of owners to conclude that it is more profitable to breed their elephants. Thus, seven respondents declared breeding their female elephant for the purpose of selling the calf. During the survey, we met eight respondents with pregnant females, six of them living in Thongmixay district close to Nam Pouy National Park and two from Hongsa and Ngeun districts. Thongmixay elephant owners dislike males and prefer to sell them (and male calves) to other districts, making their living from breeding their females with wild males. Elephant owners from northern Sayaboury province (Hongsa and Ngeun) still perpetuate a tradition of breeding their females with village males but face difficulties in finding village mates. Indeed, male elephants are not available due to their working commitments and their owners now ask expensive stud fees. With the payment of stud fees, commodification has extended to village elephant gametes. Nowadays, most elephant owners said that they had not successfully bred their elephants during the last decade, including 30 owners who said they had never bred their elephants. These changes in breeding practices stem not only from the commodification of elephants, but also arose because of a shift from a common to a divided access to natural resources.
Commodification has been accompanied by the division and privatization of natural resources. Such territorialization is best illustrated in Laos by the privatization of land and the establishment of national protected forests that prevent the free release of elephants in protected areas as well as in forest and common forage lands surrounding the villages.
With the expansion of agricultural lands (rice fields, gardens, commercial crops or tree plantations) and the systematic mapping and privatization of forest land, suitable forage lands are difficult to find. Elephants are pushed further away from the village. The reduction of grazing areas is becoming a major issue for elephant owners. More elephants are now inactive, but owners cannot release them. As a result, elephants are always chained, and release is not possible, usually because they are too many gardens and fields around that could be damaged, which would create conflicts with local communities. The permanent tethering of village elephants isolated one from each other also impairs their mating ( see Figure S2 Map of elephant- keeping areas in Ban Naven ) .
However, 19 respondents still release their elephants during a part of the year. In Champassak district, females are released in wetlands during the monsoon period. Thongmixay district also offers favourable conditions for such releases. This district is located in a remote area, landlocked between the forests along the Lao- Thai border and Nam Pouy National Park. As shown on the map drawn by local respondents ( Figure 4 ) , village elephants regularly encounter their wild congeners, allowing pairing with wild mates.
Facing similar challenges, respondents choose different alternatives. Some have chosen to optimize their incomes through tourism or breeding, while many owners did not find suitable ways to feed and keep their elephants, neither breeding them nor finding employment FI G U R E 3 Interactions between human and elephants under the current state of the social- ecological system (SES ) .

MAURER Et Al. in logging or tourism. Lao mahouts and elephant owners have been dispossessed from accessing forest areas because of land privatization or state- led legal protection. As a result, the village elephant population appears not to be self- sustaining and many owners have tried to sell their elephants, even abroad. In addition, the young generation does not seem interested in such hard work, and owners' children prefer to live in cities and are dismissive of their parents' heritage:
Young people don't like this job, it's hard to go into the forest. They all went to school; they went away from here and they don't want to come back. They want to be employed. I'm old now, if a buyer comes in, I'll sell my elephant to him. (#07, Champassak) .3 | Impact of SES changes on the elephant handling system
We describe the elephant handling system using four interconnected dimensions: the mode of production and the taskscape, in the sense of Ingold (1980 ) , the mode of relations between the mahouts and their animals, in the sense of Stépanoff (2017 ) , and the landscape (Table 2 ) . .4 | Mode of production: From pastoralism to ranching- like economy
During the 1990s, the economy of elephant handling could be seen as a form of pastoralism, where pastoralism is defined as a mode of production. Ingold (1980, p. 237) listed prerequisites for a pastoralism economy, namely: 1. Animals are convertible into basic raw materials, 2. capable of self- reproduction, 3. identifiable with forbears and progeny, 4. of relatively low reproductive potential, 5. tolerant of crowding and 6. capable of supporting itself in nature. All of these criteria were satisfied in the Lao elephant handling system, with the first condition being adapted to the specificity of village elephants, where animals are convertible into basic domestic services as draught animals. According to Ingold, the pastoralism mode of production is based on a common access to pasture with an exclusive right of disposal of the animals by the owner. The system observed in Laos during the 1990s conformed to such a mode of production, being closer to agropastoralism as elephant owners also cultivated rice. Families were engaged in a spiral of accumulation (Ingold, 1980) through the natural reproduction of their herd, aimed at providing a workforce for domestic use in a subsistence economy. A market for elephants existed under this economy, but this market concerned mainly the sale of the incremental increase in animal stock, where the owner could resort to a one- off sale of an animal or its calf to cover specific needs.
The elephant handling system has evolved in recent years to a ranching- like economy following the processes of commodification and partitioning of natural resources. This mode of production is based on the existence of a market, not only for elephants and their workforce, but also for all factors of production such as mahout labour and forage land. The owner is then engaged in a spiral of accumulation of monetary capital, where the ultimate goal is not to increase the animal stock but the profits (Ingold, 1980 ) . The owner should optimize his number of elephants according to market prices and available resources, especially FI G U R E 4 Map of elephant- keeping areas in Thongmixay district. Village elephants are either kept attached next to the village fields or released in surrounding forests where they can occasionally meet wild elephants.

MAURER Et Al. human (mahout) labour costs and foraging lands. Following the formal partitioning and privatization of land, foraging land becomes a limiting factor. As a result, population dynamics of village elephants under the ranching economy relies more on socio- economic parameters than on the elephants' reproductive potential, and the population of elephants is eventually minimized (Maurer et al., 2017 ) .
Before, elephants were cheap. There was no work at that time. Since people are making a lot of money from elephant work, their prices have gone up. The price of elephants rocketed since 2000 because their numbers have decreased. (#32, Phieng)
My elephant works all year round. He has no rest period because his owner has his own wood business. So the elephant drags logs for him all the time. ( #23- Mahout, Paklay) .5 | Taskscape: From multifunctional diversity to functional specialization
In the 1990s, all tasks were performed by the owner and his family— from capturing the elephant, to training, working, caring and blessing the animal. Elephants were used for light village work such as transporting people, firewood or rice bags or dragging of logs for house construction. Otherwise, they were released in the surrounding forests and visited occasionally by one of the co- owners or family member. TEK were transmitted from father to son. In case of need, the owner seeked the help from a specialist such as the Mo Xang (elephant ceremony master ) , the Mo feuk xang (elephant training master) or the Mo Ya (medicine master) as described by Lainé (2017a, 2018a ) . This short account summarizes the complexity of the taskscape at that time, which can be characterized by the multifunctional diversity of the actors in the framework of SES.
Nowadays, elephant handling and management tend to become part of a production chain. Timber operations require two mahouts. One rides the elephant on its neck (khuan xang, elephant mahout ) , while his assistant (khuan tin, walking mahout) remains on the ground. The latter handles the chains and facilitates the elephant's work. Work lasted for 3– 4 hr a day, with 4 resting days a month based on the lunar calendar (van sin ) . For weeks or months, humans lived in temporary forest camps made of small bamboo huts, next to their elephant. Most elephants do not perform many tasks (transportation, logging, breeding) but are rather specialized in one of them, such as logging in Paklay- Phieng, breeding in Thongmixay or tourism in Hongsa- Luang Prabang. The owner becomes a manager, or even an investor without any experience in elephant handling, like many tourism companies. The elephant TA B LE 2 Conceptual model of recent changes in the elephant handling system.

MAURER Et Al. is no longer raised by the owner or one of his sons, but by an employee. Mahouts employed in the tourism sector are mostly young and inexperienced (Suter et al., 2013 ) . They lack the traditional knowledge to care for, and control their animal. Vanitha et al. (2009) showed that elephants handled by non- traditional mahouts in South India cause higher rates of casualties and deaths among the public (or of their own mahout ) . Knowledge of traditional medicine and elephants’ reproductive behaviour are also replaced by veterinary skills, especially in tourism camps (Dubost et al., 2019; Lainé, 2017b; Suter, 2014 ) . Conflict management with wild elephants is delegated to forest department officials. Similar to other Asian countries, traditional knowledge and the art of mahoutry are dying out rapidly (Lair, 2002; Vanitha et al., 2009 ) . The taskscape is thus undergoing a recent process of functional specialization of the socio- economic actors. .6 | Mode of relations: From seasonal freedom to captivity
Pastoralism is usually associated with a relationship of domination of humans over animals. In view of the relative autonomy of village elephants, it is questionable that this condition applied here. Indeed, alternative forms of herd management based on animal autonomy and an alternance of separation and control periods have been described for reindeer herding in northern Asia (Stépanoff et al., 2017 ) , and these systems share similarities with elephant handling in Laos. The mode of relations defined by Stépanoff that best corresponds to the case of village elephants in the 1990s was an alternance of seasonal freedom and watching modes.
The privatization of forests and agricultural lands has impacted the way of life of mahouts and village elephants alike. At the very least, this situation compels village elephant owners to adopt a more intensive form of husbandry, as observed for other animals in Mongolia (Marchina, 2017) and to tether their elephants. Mahouts keep their elephants tied to a tree to prevent them from destroying neighbouring crops. Every day, mahouts have to move their elephant to a new location and let them drink. In the absence of work and income, this task is carried out at a loss, motivating many owners to sell their elephants.
Before the region was developed, there were no plantations, no market gardens, and elephants could be released for one or two months. Now it is no longer possible. There are rubber plantations, they would destroy everything, and we would have to pay. Now we have to tie up the elephants an hour's walk from the village. (#39, Hongsa)
This mode of handling is like the watching mode defined by Stépanoff (2017 ) , where food extraction remains under animal agency while the choice of foraging areas and reproduction are under human control. The development of tourism camps holding village elephants is particularly illustrative of the changes in the mode of relations. Elephants are often kept in stables and fed with cultivated fodder. They are under continuous supervision of their mahouts. Stépanoff defined as captivity a mode of husbandry where reproduction and feeding are under exclusive human control. But permanent guarding and fodder supplementation induce high costs that are hardly bearable during the low tourism season or in the event of crises that affect tourist frequentation (Duffy & Moore, 2010 ) . Ultimately, reproduction is controlled through the payment of stud fees. Ingold (1980) also mentioned that a ranching economy entails a strict control over reproduction and the selection of specific traits while pastoralists favour the animal's wild qualities. Indeed, males and aggressive elephants are highly disliked in tourism, contrary to their suitedness for logging. .7 | Landscape: From a multifunctional landscape to functional specialization
In the 1990s, the landscape was a combination of forest and fallow lands from rotational agriculture where village elephants were released. Secondary forests and fallow lands also constituted an important part of the habitat of wild elephants, especially since the ranges of individual wild elephants extend well beyond protected areas (Evans et al., 2018; Fernando & Leimgruber, 2011 ) . Landscape was characterized by its multifunctionality, being the habitat for both wild and village elephants but also a resource for humans’ livelihood through the collection of forest products, hunting or capture.
Since the late 1980s, agricultural intensification and land allocation policies have gradually led to the disappearance of secondary forests and fallow lands of shifting cultivation (Ducourtieux et al., 2005 ) . Following the process of division of natural resources described above, elephant owners have been dispossessed from accessing forest resources in common lands, reinforced by the ban to access protected areas imposed by the government and NGOs, who want to keep this habitat exclusively for wildlife conservation.
It is forbidden to tie up elephants from Nakhanyang to Muang Thongmixay. Because, if people were allowed to enter the park, then they would do something else, like hunting. (#28, official, Paklay)
Many village elephants have also been moved to semi- urban areas accessible for tourists, far from their natural habitat and their wild congeners. This situation impedes the interactions between wild and village elephants, notably mating opportunities. Similar to taskscape, the landscape is undergoing a recent process of functional specialization. Such land segregation is akin to the concept of land sparing, which consists in sparing land surface with conservation priorities through the intensification of high- yield crop farming (Perfecto & Vandermeer, 2008; Phalan et al., 2011 ) . | People and Nature
MAURER Et Al. | DISCUSSION
The relationship between humans and elephants has lasted for millennia based on a tight interlink between wild and village elephants ( Trautmann, 2015 ) . The combination of ecological, cultural and socio- economic dimensions makes the system even more complex. The rapid political, socio- economic and environmental changes occurring in Laos over the last few decades have strongly affected the conditions of this relationship. Our analysis highlights the socioeconomic and ecological factors driving changes in elephant handling and husbandry practices in Laos. Wild and village elephants were formerly closely linked at both landscape and livelihood levels, but are now found more and more in different places, managed by specialized social actors. The way of handling elephants that prevailed in the 1990s can still be found among some owners or districts, but is now being replaced by new practices, especially following the development of the elephant tourism industry. Our case study is illustrative of a wider prevalent situation faced by SES in transition due to globalized economic, social and cultural changes.
A growing number of empirical studies have described SES in transition. Many studies identified the external drivers that impact the SES and the response of communities to adapt to these changes. For instance, Forbes (2009 ) , using the example of nomadic Nenets reindeer herding people in Siberia, shows that SESs adapt to changes at multiple scales, including changes in climatic, economic and geopolitical regimes. The end of the Soviet era led to sharp declines in human communities, reindeer husbandry and economic activities in many surrounding areas of the Yamal Peninsula. But the Nenets of the Yamal Peninsula have been able to maintain a large population and economic activities, including reindeer husbandry, by adopting a flexible system combining free access to pastures and migration routes with private herd ownership.
In another context, Castella et al. (2013) described the impact of land segregation policies and new economic regime in northern Laos on the harvesting of non- timber forest products (NTFPs ) , leading to a decline in the diversity and resilience of the SES. As market access and demand increased, villagers focused on harvesting a small number of species with high economic value. The intensity of their collection then depended on price fluctuations. Castella et al. observed a process of domestication of some high- value NTFP species, intensively exploited by villagers, and their disinterest for other low- value species. The decrease in functional diversity of the NTFPs due to their intensive exploitation and the economic specialization of villagers has reduced the capacity of social actors to adapt to regime shifts.
The human– elephant SES in Laos is facing an unprecedented challenge to cope with a combination of powerful external and internal forces. Our study builds on a broad and multifaceted portray of the various forces influencing a SES in transition that could enlighten prevalent situation world- wide, way beyond elephants in Laos. External factors such as market forces as well as land and conservation policies became main drivers of the system. But our study also pointed out internal drivers affecting the capacity of communities to adapt to changes, such as the eroding willingness of the new generation to carry on with the harsh living conditions of their fathers and the consecutive loss of ecological knowledge. .1 | Characterizing a SES in transition
Despite a large body of literature theorizing SES in transition, it has been challenging to apply these paradigms to empirical cases because of the intricacy of the system's components and the multiscalar nature of changes (Pelling & Manuel- Navarrete, 2011 ) . Adaptation at one level may lead to a transformation at another level of the system (Ramprasad et al., 2020 ) . Defining the system boundaries and its normative dimensions allows to overcome the tensions whether a social- ecological change is a transformation or adaptation ( Zanotti et al., 2020 ) . Our conceptual model aims at defining the system boundaries and investigating the nature and scale of changes. Literature on the relations between Asian elephants and humans, particularly their caretakers, has mostly focused on the symbolic and inter- subjective dimensions. To bring a new insight, we built a model inspired from studies on pastoralism, with a specific interest in reindeers, that offer comparative categorizations. We concede that pastoralism and ranching may sound inappropriate in reference to elephants, but we refer to them as modes of production in the sense of Ingold. From the viewpoint of this system boundary, all four dimensions (production, taskscape, relations and landscape) involved fundamental changes to the core system functions and characteristics, akin to the transformation of the SES. However, this process of transformation is dynamic and still at work. Communities chose various strategies and could further adapt their strategies in face of dynamic changes.
Beyond our diagnosis of a transition state, it seems crucial to understand how external drivers, such as economic liberalization, land and conservation policies, as well as internal drivers linked to cultural and social changes have impacted the system core functions. At the individual level, could these dynamics of change pull away actors that are at the centre of the system towards more desirable livelihoods out of their traditional activities? .2 | Market forces are driving the fate of the human– elephant relation
Neoliberalism and the concomitant commodification of natural resources, including the privatization of common pastures, market instruments for the conservation of protected areas or the payment of stud fees, profoundly affected the SES and triggered radical changes in elephant handling practices. Since those changes have been brought to Laos, market forces became a main driver of the humanwild- captive elephants' SES. The fate of village elephants becomes highly contingent on prices and market trends. Economic criteria, such as elephant prices and availability of work in tourism or logging, have become major drivers of population dynamics through their | 13

MAURER Et Al. impact on fecundity rates. While fecundity is expected to rise again gradually in response to the rapid increase in the price of elephants, long- term equilibrium remains threatened by demand fluctuations, financial crises or economic stochasticity in the short term (Maurer et al., 2017 ) . Lair (2019) argued that a global economic crisis is the main threat to Thailand's 2,700 tourism elephants. Building on the cases of the 2002 and 2004 SRAS epidemics, he noticed that tourism employers were unable to pay for elephant food and to maintain mahout payrolls. As the Covid- 19 crisis just began to impact tourist numbers, media reported that a thousand elephants threatened by starvation migrated from tourist sites forced shut down because of the pandemic to their home villages (Thai elephants’ mass migration to village brings new stress, Phys. Org, June 2020 ) . It is somewhat early to foresee the full consequences of this global pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis on village elephants. But it seems hazardous to base survival on the ability of self- regulating markets to find a long- term equilibrium (Martin et al., 2016; Sullivan, 2011) for a species that depends on complex socio- ecological factors. Once, the elephant was a family heritage, but now it is restricted to a national heritage marketized for its tourism potential. A diversified economy and livelihood among elephant owners can surely contribute to their community adaptive capacity (Gunderson, 2010 ) . The growing specialization of the elephant economy makes the community more vulnerable and more dependent on fluctuating markets and external shocks. .3 | Land and conservation policies influence community response to changes
The process of landscape functional specialization has reduced the diversity of habitats and thereby the adaptability of the SES. Elephants favour a habitat with an intermediate disturbance regime, these habitats being mainly outside protected areas (Evans et al., 2018; Fernando & Leimgruber, 2011 ) . Less than a quarter of Asian- protected forests provide favourable habitat for elephants, because protection areas are generally concentrated in primary and old- growth forests. Forest areas exploited for timber extraction, as well as landscape mosaics from rotational agriculture, provide particularly favourable habitat for elephants but are not integrated into conservation programmes. Most Asian countries have initiated landsparing policies. This conservation approach does not match the ecological requirements and habitat preferences of wild elephants. Many other species also rely on secondary or disturbed forests. A growing body of literature shows the importance of human- modified landscapes as habitat for endangered species, including large mammals such as carnivores (Ferreira et al., 2018 ) , primates (Galán- Acedo et al., 2019) and elephants (Evans et al., 2020 ) . Village elephants also formerly shared these same habitats. The sanctuarization of forest and wild elephants in protected areas and the isolation of village elephants could eventually lead to genetic impoverishment and inbreeding depression for both populations (Hedges et al., 2008; Maurer, 2018 ) .
Landscape governance reforms are urgently needed to manage multifunctional landscapes that could benefit not only wild and village elephants but also villagers' livelihoods. In Laos, land- planning policies, including conservation strategies, are illustrative of a topdown approach from the government, international institutions and NGOs that restrains project co- construction with local communities and rarely integrates their values and knowledge. These issues, which are related to power relations and control of resources, have been widely scrutinized in relation to land- use planning, shifting cultivation and ecosystem services (Baird & Barney, 2017; Lestrelin et al.,2012; Ramcilovic- Suominen & Kotilainen, 2020 ) . Similarly, in Kerala, India, the conjunction of state- led forest protection and the development of agrarian capitalism supported by tenure systems and land reforms led to violent conflicts between local communities and wild elephants (Münster & Münster, 2012 ) . As elephants transgress the frontier, villagers turn to NGOs and the forest department to mitigate the conflict and raise protections against elephants. In addition, humans are excluded from the forest, moulding new ontologies and values. Tourism companies and welfare or conservation NGOs also promote various values and ethics regarding village elephants that contradict or oppose cultural values and local needs ( Jax et al., 2013; Lainé, 2018b ) . But the ability of communities to organize themselves and retain their ecological knowledge is fundamental to their resilience and fosters their adaptive response to changes (Barnes et al., 2017 ) . .4 | Mahout/owner' agency to pertain their activities under new conditions
The number of owners and mahouts decreases nationwide, as well as the number of elephants. The situation in which there were many owners/mahouts, usually from the same family, owning several elephants, is being increasingly replaced by one owner for one or several elephants, each elephant being cared for by one full- time mahout. The functional diversity— the role and functions that species or social actors play in the system— is reduced. Some owners would prefer to maintain their former practices but face new socioecological conditions that make this difficult. Many owners are selling or renting their elephants abroad, especially in China. If most owners declared they like their job and way of life, they also prefer their sons to avoid enduring such harsh living conditions in the forest under the rain. Their descendants also value working on a computer in an office rather than in the forest.
As a result, the decline in father- to- son transmission undermines traditional ecological knowledge. The loss of know- how and the absence of technical innovations (Ingold, 1980) threaten the long- term sustainability of this new intensive and specialized mode of husbandry. Traditional medicine is replaced by veterinary skills ( Dubost et al., 2019; Lainé, 2015 ) . Veterinarians are also supervising reproduction, especially in tourism camps, amid plummeting rates in fecundity. We illustrate how elephant husbandry in Laos has become more contingent on specialized actors such as tourism companies, | People and Nature
MAURER Et Al. veterinarians, government officials and NGOs. We can wonder if this functional specialization of socio- economic actors could reduce the system's resilience in Laos, as shown in other contexts (Forbes et al., 2009; Grêt- Regamey et al., 2019 ) .
Overall, the decline in mahout and owner numbers can be explained by a combination of factors such as the decrease in elephant population, new handling practices and growing economic and regulations constraints pushing them to leave their activity. We also shed light on additional internal drivers more connected to change in social and cultural values that found echoes in a cultural and economic globalized world. For instance, similar processes have been described for the SES of artisanal fisheries in Norway (Johnsen & Vik, 2013) or Chile (Tam et al., 2018 ) . Attitudes and behaviours among fishers appear to have shifted with economic development, favouring education, professions of higher status and greater economic security (Tam et al., 2018 ) . The lack of recruitment and loss of interest from the young generation is threatening the sustainability of the system from the inside.
There is an urgent need to promote collaborative governance, community- based management, knowledge integration among multiple stakeholders and address the young generation desires and expectations to allow elephant owner and mahout communities to adapt to both gradual change and unforeseen disasters. | CONCLUSION
Simple dichotomies between nature and society, local and global, and economy and ecology prevent us from handling the complexity of interrelations existing ‘in- between’ and favours the processes of ‘purification’ (Latour, 1991 ) . In Laos, the social control over nature is replaced by a clear demarcation and purification process between the village and the forest poles. Thus deforestation can be regarded by Lao people as a sign of social improvement, since civilized and prosperous (chaleun) areas are expanding (Singh, 2009 ) . However, the long- term survival of wild elephants may be compromised by repeated poaching of wild elephants and encroachment of their habitat, genetic isolation, increasing hostility towards the species and the alarming rise of conflicts between humans and elephants. The ontological dichotomy between the wild and village animals is getting stronger. Wild individuals are perceived more and more as different species, living in different habitats.
Meanwhile, a broad range of stakeholders— mahouts and elephant owners, the Lao society, tourism companies, welfare organizations, conservation NGOs, governmental and international institutions— are promoting their own agendas, values and knowledge without proper dialogue and coordination.
Forbes (2009) argues that ‘relationships are as fundamental as places and things. Conservationists made a strategic error in assuming that our work is more a legal act than a cultural act, in assuming that we can protect land from people through laws, as opposed to with people through relationships. Laws codify values; they do not create them’. The emerging literature on relational values provides new perspectives that resonate with the complex challenge of conserving Asian elephants, whether they are wild or under human care, a cultural icon or a family heritage. Relational values, which relate to individual and collective well- being, encompass relationships and interactions between people and nature, including relationships between people through nature (Chan et al., 2016 ) . Relational values link cultural practices and places, or what we call here the landscape, where people can experience and care for nature. Conservation programs have been criticized for not integrating sufficiently the needs, values and knowledge of local people. Chan et al. (2016) advocate for rethinking conservation strategies through the lens of relational values. Such an approach could help cultivate relationships between stakeholders and more effectively engage local communities, building on their cultural identities, knowledge, stewardship and social responsibility.
While facing new challenges, the long- lasting relationship between humans and Asian elephants will either adapt or transform into new pathways. But the shape of this future coexistence will depend above all on the relationships that will be woven between people, places and elephants.

Calls for using marine protected areas (MPAs) to achieve goals for nature and people are increasing globally. While the conservation and fisheries impacts of MPAs have been comparatively well studied, impacts on other dimensions of human use have received less attention. Understanding how humans engage with MPAs and identifying traits of MPAs that promote engagement is critical to designing MPA networks that achieve multiple goals effectively, equitably, and with minimal environmental impact. . In this paper, we characterize human engagement in California's MPA network, the largest scientifically-based network of MPAs in the world (124 MPAs spanning 16% of state waters and 1,700 km of coastline ) , and identify traits associated with higher human engagement. We assemble and compare diverse indicators of human engagement that capture recreational, educational, and scientific activities across California’s MPAs. . We find that human engagement is correlated with nearby population density and that site “charisma” can expand human engagement beyond what would be predicted based on population density alone. Charismatic MPAs tend to be located near tourist destinations, have long sandy beaches, and be adjacent to state parks and associated amenities. In contrast, underutilized MPAs were often more remote and lacked both sandy beaches and parking lot access. . Synthesis and applications: These results suggest that achieving MPA goals associated with human engagement can be promoted by developing land-based amenities that increase access to coastal MPAs or by locating new MPAs near existing amenities during the design phase. Alternatively, human engagement can be limited by locating MPAs in areas far from population centers, coastal amenities, or sandy beaches. Furthermore, managers may want to prioritize monitoring, enforcement, education, and outreach programs in MPAs with traits that predict high human engagement. Understanding the extent to which human engagement impacts the conservation performance of MPAs is a critical next step to designing MPAs that minimize tradeoffs among potentially competing objectives.

Introduction Marine protected areas (MPAs) — places where human activity, especially extractive practices such as fishing, is prohibited or restricted — are a common ocean management tool used to achieve a mixture of conservation, fisheries, and cultural objectives (Erskine et al., ; Grorud-Colvert et al., 2021; Marcos et al., 2021 ) . By restricting extractive and destructive human activities, adequately designed, funded, and regulated MPAs can increase the diversity and abundance of marine fish and invertebrates (Edgar et al., 2014; Gill et al., 2017; Goetze et al., 2021; Zupan et al., 2018) and the function and resilience of marine ecosystems (Cheng et al., 2019; Mellin et al., 2016 ) . In the long term, and with concerted community participation and buy-in, well-designed MPAs can also yield fisheries benefits through increased productivity and spillover resulting from improved biomass and age structure of populations in the MPA (Di Lorenzo et al., 2020; Marshall et al., 2019 ) . Furthermore, MPAs can facilitate and enhance other non-extractive human engagement in ocean ecosystems, such as cultural activities, recreation and tourism, education and outreach, and scientific research (Angulo-Valdés & Hatcher, 2010; Ban et al., 2019; Erskine et al., 2021; Roncin et al., 2008 ) . While the ability and prerequisites for MPAs to achieve conservation and fisheries objectives have been comparatively well-studied (e.g., (Claudet et al., 2008; Edgar et al., 2014; Giakoumi et al., 2017; Goñi et al., 2010; Lester & Halpern, 2008; Wilson et al., 2020 ) ) , the enabling conditions for achieving other human use objectives has received less attention (Ban et al., 2019; Erskine et al., 2021; Gerber et al., 2003; Naidoo et al., 2019; Turnbull et al., 2021 ) . This is surprising given the frequency with which human engagement objectives — such as recreation, education, and scientific research — are identified in international, national, and regional MPA planning documents. For example, the Independent World Commission on the Oceans identifies the “provision of areas for scientific research, education, and recreation” as a key benefit of MPAs (IWCO, 1998 ) . Similarly, the U.S. Framework for the National System of Marine Protected Areas identifies the benefits of U.S. MPAs as: (1) “supporting social and economic benefits [including] coastal tourism”, (2) “providing new educational opportunities”, and (3) “enhancing research opportunities” (NOAA, 2015 ) . In some cases, MPAs may aim to achieve cultural, spiritual, emotional, or intrinsic value benefits (Allison et al., 2020 ) . Evaluating human engagement in MPAs is needed to track progress towards achieving these objectives and for identifying the design principles that determine human engagement in MPAs. Here, we use California’s MPA network, the largest scientifically-based MPA network in the world, as a case study for identifying conditions that promote or limit human engagement in MPAs. In 1999, the California state legislature passed the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA ) , which directed the state to use the best available science to redesign and greatly expand its system of MPAs to function as a coherent network and to address six goals in service of conservation, fisheries, and other cultural objectives (Marine Life Protection Act, 1999; Gleason et al., 2013 ) . In addition to goals to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem function and to sustain, conserve, protect, and rebuild marine populations, including those of economic value, the MLPA also included a goal to “improve recreational, educational, and study opportunities provided by marine ecosystems that are subject to minimal human disturbance, and to manage these uses in a manner consistent with protecting biodiversity.” From 2004 to 2012, a community-driven and science-guided design process led to a coordinated network of 124 MPAs, containing 16% of state waters, along California’s 1,770 km (1,100 miles) coastline. Following implementation, an extensive monitoring effort began to ensure that the network could undergo adaptive management (Botsford et al., 2014 ) . While some monitoring programs were developed around human engagement in MPAs (e.g., the MPA Watch citizen science program; (MPA Watch, b ) ) , the majority of the monitoring effort was focused on the ecological goals of the MLPA and on elucidating ecological responses to MPA implementation. Here, we characterize human engagement in California’s MPA network and identify traits associated with high engagement. We assemble and evaluate diverse indicators of engagement that capture a range of recreational, educational, and scientific activities. We then relate levels of human engagement to population density, accessibility, amenities, and other traits likely to influence engagement. This provides a rare quantification of the ways in which people engage with MPAs and the potential pathways for enhancing or limiting engagement based on management goals. These insights are helpful as California (Executive Order N-82-20, 2020 ) , the United States (Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, 2021 ) , and the world (CBD, 2021) aim to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 (30x30) to meet an array of conservation, fisheries, and other cultural objectives (Sullivan-Stack et al., 2022 ) . . Methods .1 Marine protected areas California’s coastal waters are protected by a mosaic of spatial management areas that vary in regulatory authority and protection status (Fig. 1A; Table S1 ) . State-managed areas include: (1) state marine reserves (SMRs ) , which prohibit all fishing; (2) state marine conservation areas (SMCAs ) , which restrict some types of fishing, except for within special notake SMCAs, which prohibit all fishing; (3) state marine recreational managed areas (SMRMAs ) , which restrict fishing and allow hunting of waterfowl; (4) state marine parks (SMPs ) , which prohibit commercial fishing; and (5) special closures, which restrict activity around seabird colonies and marine mammal haulouts and are the only designation not defined as an MPA by the MLPA (Table S1 ) . Federal marine reserves and conservation areas (FMRs and FMCAs, respectively) extend certain SMRs and SMCAs around the Channel Islands into federal waters ( Fig. 1A ) . We focus on the 124 MPAs that the MLPA identifies as being part of California’s statemanaged coastal MPA network (Fig. 1A; Table S1 ) . This excludes federally managed MPAs around the Channel Islands; SMRAs and SMPs in San Francisco Bay, which were established before the MLPA planning process and are not coastal; and special closures, which are not identified as MPAs by the MLPA. We refer to the resulting network of 49 SMRs, 60 SMCAs, 10 no-take SMCAs, and 5 SMRMAs as California’s state MPA network. While the Channel Islands MPAs were established before the MLPA planning process, they have been legally incorporated into the network. The four MLPA regions (South, Central, North Central, and North Coasts; Fig. ) encompass a wide range of ecological dynamics, coastal features, oceanographic environments, cultures, and economies. .2 Surrounding human communities We hypothesized that the number of people living near an MPA and the socioeconomic vulnerability of this population would contribute to engagement levels. In short, we expected that MPAs with larger and less vulnerable nearby human populations would experience greater human engagement. We characterized the human population living near MPAs using population demographics data from the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census (USCB, 2010a ) . The 2010 data is the most recent available data given extended delays in the release of the 2020 U.S. Census data ( Schneider, 2023 ) . We downloaded total population estimates by census block, the smallest geographic unit used in the census, using the tidycensus R package (Walker et al., 2022) and calculated the density of people living within each block. We rasterized (500x500 m resolution) these data and calculated the number of people living within a 50 km radius (~31 miles) of each MPA (Fig. 1B ) . The number of people living within 50 km is generally (r2 > 0.8) correlated with population densities using buffer distances ranging from 10 to 100 km (~6-60 miles) (Fig. S1 ) . We estimated the social vulnerability of these populations using twelve indicators identified by (Jepson & Colburn, 2013) and collected by the U.S. Census American Community Survey (USCB, 2010b ) . These indicators describe various metrics of poverty status, housing characteristics, labor force structure, and population composition (Table S2; Figures S2-S4 ) . We downloaded these indicators by census tract, the smallest geographic unit for which all of the indicators were available (one level larger than census block ) , also using the tidycensus R package (Walker et al., 2022 ) . We combined these indicators into a single vulnerability index by averaging the z-scores of each indicator (i.e., indicators were centered on the statewide average and scaled to unit variance ) . Thus, a value of zero indicates average vulnerability across all of the various indicators, negative values indicate higher than average vulnerability, and positive values indicate lower than average vulnerability. We rasterized the tract-level index to match the population raster and calculated the average vulnerability of the population within km of each MPA as the population-weighted average of the social vulnerability index. .3 Human engagement in protected areas We developed indicators of human engagement in recreational, educational, and scientific activities in California’s state MPA network using a mixture of citizen science, naturalist, and state agency datasets (Table S3 ) . We focused on recreational, educational, and scientific engagement given that they are specific objectives of the network (Marine Life Protection Act, 1999) and given the lack of data on other cultural, spiritual, or emotional types of human engagement. We used data from two citizen science programs (MPA Watch and Reef Environmental Education Foundation) and two naturalist social networks (iNaturalist and eBird ) , which provide spatially referenced records of activities (e.g., surfing, swimming, boating, tidepooling, diving, etc.) or observations of wildlife submitted by individual users, as indicators of recreational and educational engagement in MPAs. While popular social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter may provide a better indicator of visitation rates than specialist platforms such as iNaturalist and eBird (Tenkanen et al., 2017 ) , the volume of data generated by these platforms requires careful subsampling to be manageable (e.g., ( Hausmann et al., 2017 ) ) . Although analysis of these social media indicators of engagement was outside the scope of this study, we encourage their use in future research. We used data from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) on the annual numbers of permits issued for scientific research in California’s MPAs as an indicator of scientific engagement. Finally, we used CDFW data on regulatory citations as an indicator of regulatory compliance within the network. We used MPA Watch survey data to measure consumptive and non-consumptive human activities in California’s MPA network. MPA Watch is a citizen science program that trains volunteers to observe and collect data on human engagement in protected areas (MPA Watch, 2022b ) . Volunteers use a standardized survey protocol (MPA Watch, 2022a) to record consumptive (e.g., fishing) and non-consumptive (e.g., surfing, boating, tidepooling, running, etc.) activities occurring both on- and off-shore of coastal sampling sites (Table S4 ) . Consumptive activities are classified as either active (e.g., fishing line in water) or inactive (e.g., fishing pole on boat but not being used ) ; we focus on active consumptive activities. We caution that SMRMAs and some SMCAs allow some forms of harvest and that MPA Watch volunteers, while well trained, are not legal authorities on MPA boundaries and regulations. Thus, ability to infer the legality of consumptive activities documented by MPA Watch volunteers is limited. MPA Watch has been in operation since 2011 and, as of writing, has conducted over 33,000 surveys in 49 MPAs (47 of which meet our inclusion criteria) and 60 control (non-MPA) locations ( Fig. S5 ) . While some MPAs have been surveyed consistently since 2011, others did not receive consistent visits until 2015 or later (Fig. S5A ) . To allow comparison between sites with variable temporal coverage, we limited analysis to surveys that took place from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2021. To eliminate spurious results from surveys that were conducted either early in the morning or late at night or were either shorter or longer than the official protocol ( MPA Watch, 2022a ) , we also limited analysis to surveys that occurred between 6AM and 8PM and lasted between 10 and 60 minutes (Fig. S5BC ) . We quantified human engagement by MPA in terms of (1) the percent of surveys in which an activity was observed and (2) the median number of activities observed per hour for surveys in which activities were observed (zeroes excluded because of high zero-inflation) (Figs. S6 & S7 ) . We used iNaturalist submission records to measure engagement in wildlife observation within and adjacent to MPAs. iNaturalist is a web- and app-based platform that allows observers to submit wildlife photos for identification by amateur and professional naturalists (iNaturalist, ). iNaturalist was launched in 2008 and as of writing, has more than 100 million observations, 2 million observers, and 380,000 observed species globally. We used the rinat R package (Barve et al., 2021) to download all iNaturalist observations submitted by users in a bounding box spanning the California coastline from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2021 ( iNaturalist allows back submissions, hence the availability of pre-2008 observations ) . We defined MPA-associated observations as observations occurring within 100 meters of an MPA and quantified human engagement from 2012 through 2021 by MPA in terms of the number of ( 1) unique observers (number of iNaturalist users who submitted wildlife observations) and (2) observations (number of entries submitted ) . More than 5,800 observers have submitted >72,000 observations associated with 121 of California’s state MPAs (Figs. S8 & S9 ) . We used eBird submission records to measure engagement in birding within and adjacent to MPAs. eBird is a global program that collates observations of birds submitted by birdwatchers (eBird, 2022 ) . It was launched in 2002 by the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society but allows back submissions from birding diaries. As a result, eBird contains observations dating back centuries in many locations. As of writing, the eBird includes over 69.7 million submissions from nearly 800,000 birders. We downloaded eBird observations from California and, as with the iNaturalist data, identified observations occurring within 100 meters of an MPA from 2012 through 2021. We quantified human engagement by MPA in terms of the number of (1) unique observers and (2) observations. More than 19,000 birders have conducted >193,000 surveys and made >3.8 million submissions to eBird associated with 114 of California’s state MPAs (Figs. S10 & S11 ) . We used Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) diver surveys as an indicator of engagement in diving and snorkeling in California’s MPAs. REEF is an international marine conservation organization that trains volunteer SCUBA divers and snorkelers to collect and report information on marine fish and select invertebrate and algae species during recreational SCUBA dives and snorkels (REEF, 2022 ) . The diver survey program was launched in 1993 and, as of writing, has >250,000 surveys by 16,000 volunteers at 15,000 sites worldwide. We received records of >14,700 surveys conducted in California and identified 4,085 surveys occurring within 41 of California’s state MPAs from 2012 through 2021 (Figs. S12 & S13 ) . We quantified human engagement by MPA in terms of the (1) number of surveys conducted and (2) number of years in which a survey was conducted. We used records of scientific permits issued by CDFW for research conducted within California’s MPA network as an indicator of the contributions of MPAs to scientific knowledge. While permits are required for any extractive or manipulative research in California’s coastal waters, purely observational research (i.e., research without capturing, handling, etc.) does not require permits; thus, the permit data may underestimate the amount of research occurring in the network. From 2012-2021, 5,329 scientific permits were issued for research in all 124 of California’s state MPAs (Figs. S14 & S15 ) . We quantified human engagement by MPA in terms of the (1) number of permits issued and (2) number of years in which permits were issued. We used records of citations issued by the CDFW Law Enforcement Division for regulatory violations occurring within California’s MPA network as an indicator of compliance. From 2016-2021, 2,812 citations were issued for violations occurring within 85 of California’s state MPAs (Figs. S16 & S17 ) . We quantified non-compliance by MPA in terms of the (1) number of citations issued and (2) number of years in which citations were issued. We used generalized linear models assuming a Poisson distribution to evaluate the correlation between the total number of citations issued within an MPA and human population density, human engagement (defined using the iNaturalist observer data ) , and observations of active fishing ( defined using the MPA Watch survey data ) . We caution that the lack of effort information limits our ability to infer non-compliance rates (i.e., do more citations correspond to more effort or more illegal activity) and advise that CDFW record information on effort (e.g., number of patrol hours) to improve ability to document patterns of non-compliance and target patrol strategies. To compare human engagement across indicators (Fig. 2 ) , we selected key metrics for each indicator (Table S3) to display in an engagement scorecard (Fig. 3 ) . We centered each metric on its mean and scaled it to unit variance to facilitate comparisons across indicators. We also measured and compared the degree to which engagement is concentrated within specific MPAs, a metric of the selectivity of users, by developing the engagement accumulation curves shown in Figure 4. We developed these curves by first calculating the percent contribution of each MPA to network-wide engagement for each of the metrics selected for the scorecard. We then plotted the accumulation of these contributions beginning with the MPA with the highest engagement and ending with the MPA with the lowest engagement. The steeper the resulting curve, the more network-wide engagement is dominated by a few MPAs. .4 Drivers of human engagement We hypothesized that human engagement in MPAs would be correlated with nearby population density (Cinner et al., 2018; Ravenstein, 1885) except for (1) “charismatic” MPAs that draw participation from afar and thus generate more engagement than would be predicted based on nearby population density, and (2) “underutilized” MPAs that are difficult to access ( e.g., located offshore, limited road access, etc.) and thus generate less engagement than would be predicted based on nearby population density. To distinguish charismatic and underutilized MPAs, we regressed human engagement (as measured by the number of iNaturalist observers) against population density and extracted the MPAs that fell above ( charismatic) or below (underutilized) 75% of the fitted values (Fig. 5 ) . For this model, we used the number of iNaturalist observers as our measure of human engagement because it was the most spatially comprehensive indicator (i.e., describes engagement in the greatest number of MPAs) and it correlates with all of the indicators of non-extractive engagement (i.e., it is not correlated with citations or consumptive activities; Fig. S18 ) . We used logistic regression to identify traits associated with charismatic and underutilized MPAs (Fig. 6 ) . We considered 13 traits describing a range of MPA design features ( age, size, protection level ) , habitats (sandy beach, rocky intertidal, kelp, estuary ) , accessibility and amenities (distance to port; number of parks, parking lots, campgrounds, and picnic areas within 1 km ) , and the social vulnerability index. See Table S5 for the source of each explanatory variable. We then used a series of logistic regressions to evaluate the association between engagement (charismatic vs. typical and underutilized vs. typical) and these traits. We defined the logistic target level for each model based on “typical” MPAs (response of 0) versus charismatic or underutilized (response of 1 ) . Logistic models were constructed stepwise after a priori identifying relevant drivers of engagement. The best fitting models were selected using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) to identify the most parsimonious model of the relationship between engagement and the evaluated traits. .5 Comparison to non-MPA areas The methods described above were used to determine which MPAs within California’s MPA network generate the most human engagement and to identify the factors that drive differences in the levels of engagement; however, they are unable to reveal whether MPAs generate more, less, or equivalent human engagement as similar non-MPA areas. To understand the degree to which MPA designations impact human engagement in coastal areas, we rasterized California’s state waters into 200 m raster cells and paired each MPA cell with a non-MPA counterfactual cell with otherwise similar properties. We identified non-MPA counterfactual cells that were similar to their MPA reference cells in their depth (m ) , distance from shore (km ) , nearby population density, proximity to parks, and proximity to public beaches. These matching variables were selected based on their association with engagement as revealed through the regression analysis (Fig. 6 ) . We derived these values for both MPA and counterfactual cells using the sources listed in Table S6. We identified suitable counterfactuals through statistical matching using the MatchIt package (D. Ho et al., 2011 ) , using one-to-one Mahalanobis distance matching with replacement and propensity score calipers of 0.20 standard deviations (D. E. Ho et al., 2007 ) . After an appropriate counterfactual was identified for each MPA cell (Figure S19 ) , we calculated the log-response ratio of the sum of activities within each MPA’s cells and its paired counterfactuals cells for the three engagement indicators with activities reported inside and outside MPAs using GPS coordinates (i.e., the iNaturalist, eBird, and REEF indicators ) . We tested whether the mean log-ratio of these sums differed from zero using t-tests (i.e., whether MPAs and non-MPAs generate different levels of human engagement ) . Log-response ratios were calculated after adding 1 to the engagement values occurring in both the numerator and denominator to avoid non-finite ratio values. All data analysis and visualization was done in R (R Core Team, 2021) and all data and code are available on GitHub here: https://github.com/NCEAS/ca-mpa . Results .1 Human engagement in protected areas MPA Watch volunteers observed non-consumptive activities in the vast majority of surveys conducted coastwide and within all of the 47 surveyed MPAs (Fig. 2A ) . MPA visitors were most commonly observed walking and recreating on the beach, often with their pets. Offshore recreation included boating, surfing, bodyboarding, and swimming. MPA visitors were also often observed viewing wildlife and exploring tidepools (Fig. S6BC ) . MPAs in the South Coast region were most popular, especially those near the metropolitan areas of San Diego and Los Angeles (Fig. 2A ) . MPA Watch volunteers observed active consumptive activities (i.e., fishing and hand collection of organisms) in all but four of the 47 surveyed MPAs (Fig. 2B) but at rates substantially lower than those observed for non-consumptive activities (Fig. S7BC ) . Hook and line fishing was the most commonly observed consumptive activity and was observed in ~6% of surveys within SMCAs (MPAs in which certain types of fishing are often allowed ) . However, active hook and line fishing was also reported by volunteers in surveys in no-take SMCAs ( ~1.8% of surveys) and SMRs (~2% of surveys) (Fig. S7B ) . Hand collection of organisms, trap fishing, and spear fishing were the next most frequently reported consumptive activities. Net fishing, dive fishing, commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fishing, and kelp harvest were more rarely reported (Fig. S7BC ) . Observations of consumptive activities were more frequent in South Coast MPAs and within SMCAs, which allow some types of harvest. The number of people submitting wildlife observations to iNaturalist from within California’s MPA network increased through time (Fig. S8BC ) . The majority of observers submit observations from only one MPA per year, but some observers make submissions from up to 21 MPAs per year (Fig. S8C ) . Observers are especially interested in plants (often land-based ) , shells (mollusks ) , and seabirds (Fig. S8B ) . iNaturalist participation is especially high in the touristic Monterey Bay area and secondarily high in the densely populated San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco areas (Fig. 2C ) . MPA engagement was less selective than predicted by human population density for this form of human engagement (Fig. 4 ) . On average, California’s MPAs have not generated more iNaturalist engagement than counterfactual sites (p=0.12 ) , indicating that non-MPA areas with similar features generate just as much engagement as MPAs for this type of activity (Fig. 7 ) . Birders have been visiting California’s MPAs since before they were designated as protected areas (Fig. S11BC ) . The participation of birders in the eBird citizen science program increased linearly from the 1960-2005 and exponentially since 2005 (Fig. S11B ) . Participation has been greatest, in terms of number of birders submitting eBird observations, at popular birding hotspots such as Bolsa Chica Basin SMCA, Elkhorn Slough SMR, Matlahuayl SMR, Morro Bay SMRMA, and Point Reyes SMR (Figs. 2D & 3 ) . MPAs within estuaries -- including Bolsa Chica Basin, Elkhorn Slough, and Morro Bay -- generate a disproportionate amount of eBird activity: despite representing only 2% of California’s state MPA network by area (17% by count ) , around 40% of recent annual visits to the network logged by eBirders have been within estuarine MPAs (Fig. S11C ) . Despite the tendency for eBirders to visit estuarine MPAs, the selectivity of birders was generally proportional to that predicted by population density (Fig. 4 ) , suggesting that estuarine MPAs are located in areas with high population density. On average, California’s MPAs have generated slightly more eBird engagement than counterfactual sites ( p=0.02 ) , indicating that MPA status attracts engagement for this type of activity (Fig. 7 ) . The number of recreational divers and snorkelers contributing to the REEF citizen science survey program from within California’s MPA network increased from the program’s inception in 1994 to a peak in 2011, then decreased until a resurgence during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) (Fig. S13BC ) . Participants visited a range of habitats and depths but generally favored kelp forests and rocky reefs (Fig. S13BC ) . The majority of participation has come from MPAs with high profile dive sites including, in decreasing order of prevalence, Matlahuayl SMR, Edward F. Ricketts SMCA, Point Lobos SMR, Pacific Grove Marine Gardens SMCA, and Carmel Bay SMCA (Figs. 2E & 3 ) . REEF divers have been more selective in their MPA visitation than any of the other evaluated user groups (Fig. 4 ) . California’s MPAs have, on average, generated much more REEF survey engagement than counterfactual sites (p < 0.0001 ) , indicating that MPA status attracts engagement for this type of activity (Fig. 7 ) . The number of scientific permits issued for research within California’s MPA network has been variable through time and decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) (Fig. S15B ) . The distribution of scientific research throughout the MPA network has been more even than other types of human engagement (Fig. 4 ) . In general, fewer permits have been issued for research in the North and North Central Coast regions and more permits have been issued for research in the Central (especially Monterey Bay) and South (especially Los Angeles and San Diego) Coast regions (Figs. 2F & 3 ) , where academic institutions and marine science nonprofits are more highly concentrated. Scientific research in MPAs of different designations has generally occurred in proportion to the representation of the different MPA designations within the network (i.e., no bias towards no-take areas) (Fig. S15C ) . The number of citations issued for regulatory violations was highest in MPAs in the South Coast region, especially in the MPAs around Catalina Island, a major tourist destination off the coast of Los Angeles (Fig. S17A ) . In general, the number of citations is positively correlated with nearby human population size (p < 0.001; Fig. S17B) and human engagement ( p < 0.001; Fig. S17C) in MPAs, where engagement is defined as the total number of people contributing iNaturalist observations from within an MPA from 2012-2021. Interestingly, the number of citations was negatively correlated with the observation of active consumptive activity by MPA Watch observers (Fig. S17D ) , which could indicate that the active consumptive activity reported by MPA Watch observers is sanctioned or that active consumptive activity is more prominent in areas with less active enforcement. Citations were more highly concentrated in certain MPAs than would be predicted by human population density alone (Fig. 4 ) . .2 Drivers of human engagement Across all indicators, human engagement in MPAs was highest in the populous South Coast region and the touristic Monterey Bay area in the Central Coast region, and lowest in the remote North Coast region (Figs. 2 & 3 ) . We found that human engagement in MPAs was correlated to nearby population density (r2=0.14; p < 0.001) but that MPA traits can enhance or reduce engagement beyond what would be predicted based on population density alone (Fig. ). Elevated engagement in 20 “charismatic” MPAs (MPAs whose engagement is greater than would be expected based on population density) was associated with older MPAs with long sandy beaches and many adjacent land-based parks (Fig. 6; Table S7 ) . Reduced engagement in 42 “underutilized” MPAs (MPAs whose engagement is lower than would be expected based on population density) was associated with remoteness (i.e., far from the nearest port ) , lack of sandy beaches, and lack of parking lot access (Fig. 6; Table S7 ) . . Discussion Understanding the ability and prerequisites for MPAs to achieve human use objectives is central to designing MPA networks that provide multiple benefits to people and nature. California’s MPA network supports a diverse array of recreational, educational, and scientific activities. MPAs are commonly used for recreational activities such as walking, playing, or relaxing on the beach or boating, surfing, swimming, or SCUBA diving in the ocean. Engagement in these activities makes important contributions to local economies (Pendleton & Kildow, 2006) and to cultural, emotional, and physical health (Hipp & Ogunseitan, 2011; Jacobson, 2020 ) . Wildlife viewing is also common within California’s MPAs and provides a platform for education and research. Many visitors engage in MPAs through citizen science programs that provide opportunities both to learn about the natural world and to contribute to meaningful scientific datasets (Freiwald et al., 2018; Rapacciuolo et al., 2021 ) . Finally, scientific researchers have utilized the MPA network as a “large-scale ecological experiment” (sensu ( Jensen et al., 2012 ) ) to derive globally-relevant insights into MPA performance, marine ecology, and fisheries and conservation science (e.g., (Starr et al., 2015; White et al., 2021; Ziegler et al., 2022 ) ) . However, not all MPAs generate equal levels of human engagement. In general, engagement is positively correlated with surrounding human population density: the more people living near an MPA, the more engagement an MPA generates. Charismatic MPAs, MPAs that receive more engagement than would be expected based on nearby population density, likely draw additional users because they have adjacent land-based attractions (i.e., parks) and associated amenities (e.g., parking lots, restrooms, campgrounds ) . These MPAs also have higher amounts of sandy beaches, which based on the MPA Watch surveys, tend to generate higher engagement than rocky beaches. Furthermore, many of the charismatic MPAs are located in areas spanning the Monterey Bay and Big Sur coastlines and the city of San Diego, which attract high numbers of tourists. These results are consistent with studies of landbased protected areas that find that visitation rates are driven primarily by the availability of amenities such as parking lots, walking paths, and campgrounds and the accessibility of parks to human populations (see (Heagney et al., 2018) and references within ) . Finally, engagement is moderated by the selectivity of different user groups. For example, whereas divers are highly selective in their choice of MPAs to visit, scientists have conducted research much more evenly across the statewide MPA network. Birders disproportionately visit estuarine MPAs, which tend to harbor large bird populations due to their high productivity (Paracuellos & Tellería, 2004 ) . It is also critical to understand patterns of unsanctioned use within California’s MPA network. Overall, consumptive use was observed in a higher proportion of surveys conducted in MPAs that allow some types of harvest (i.e., SMCAs and SMRMAs) than in fully no-take MPAs that prohibit all fishing (i.e., SMRs and no-take SMCAs ) . However, MPA Watch surveys, which we caution are conducted by citizen scientists and not by law enforcement officers, document fishing inside many of California’s no-take MPAs. While observed much less frequently than non-consumptive activities, fishing was still reported in 10% of all MPA Watch surveys conducted in no-take MPAs. The vast majority of reported fishing in no-take areas was by recreational anglers using hook-and-line fishing gear. In most cases, we suspect this was due to a lack of education on the location of MPA boundaries by recreational anglers, as opposed to deliberate poaching activities. The rare observation of commercial fishing in MPAs suggests high compliance by the commercial fleet, which is highly informed about the location and regulations of MPAs. This is consistent with official summaries showing that, in 2011 (the most recent year with publicly available data ) , 271 citations were issued to commercial fishers while ,052 citations were issued to recreational fishers (~4 times larger than the number issued to recreational hunters) (CDFW, 2011 ) . This suggests that outreach within the recreational fishing community could be especially effective at increasing compliance with MPA regulations. Our findings have several key management implications. If promoting human engagement in MPAs is a management objective, our results suggest that MPA planners could improve access and promote engagement either by (1) locating new MPAs in areas with adjacent land-based parks and amenities or (2) investing in the development of new land-based parks and/or amenities adjacent to existing MPAs. Furthermore, aligning protections on land and sea could improve MPA performance by preventing pollution, sedimentation, or eutrophication resulting from run-off from land-based activities (Cicin-Sain & Belfiore, 2005 ) . Alternatively, if reducing human engagement is desired — for example, to enhance protection of biodiversity or other ecosystem or cultural services sensitive to human visitation or to limit cumulative stressors to promote climate resilience — then planners could locate MPAs far from people or land-based parks and amenities (Campbell et al., 2020 ) . Our results could also help guide decisions about where to invest in the monitoring, enforcement, and outreach programs required to ensure compliance (Murray & Hee, 2019 ) . We found that the citation frequency for MPA rule violations increased with engagement and adjacent population size. These programs may want to prioritize MPAs in areas of high population density and with adjacent land-based amenities and sandy beaches. However, remote MPAs can also be areas of elevated noncompliance due to lower levels of perceived risk of detection (Crawford et al., 2004; Rojo et al., ), and enforcement should not entirely abandon these areas. In addition to monitoring and enforcement, expanded education and outreach is needed to prevent non-compliance before it happens, especially amongst recreational anglers (Bergseth & Roscher, 2018 ) . Equitable human engagement in California’s MPA network is also an important socioeconomic objective. Unfortunately, the indicators of engagement evaluated here do not include demographic information on the identity of human users, limiting our ability to evaluate the equity of engagement among different user groups. The collection of information in the identity of MPA users is thus a vital first step towards considering equity in future MPA planning and outreach. Knowledge of the representativeness of current users is necessary to design and implement programs that promote access and engagement among underrepresented groups. This knowledge could be gained by interviewing MPA visitors in intercept surveys and assessing the composition of these users relative to that of surrounding communities (e.g., ( Scully-Engelmeyer et al., 2021 ) ) . It could also be gained through focus groups with the various community organizations that engage with MPAs, such as fishing, diving, and/or birding clubs, or direct interaction with communities (e.g., (Diedrich et al., 2017 ) ) . The equity of access and engagement should be considered at the outset of any additional MPA planning, including the identification of methods for tracking and benchmarking progress towards these objectives. As California prepares to expand its MPA network to meet 30x30 goals, it will be important to build on the successes and lessons of the original participatory planning process (Gleason et al., ) to further enhance the ability for community members, especially indigenous people, to ensure that their values are reflected in the objectives, regulations, and design of the expanded network (Voyer et al., 2015; Voyer & Gladstone, 2018 ) . MPAs with low human engagement can still provide valuable contributions to the human engagement, conservation, and fisheries goals of the MPA network. While total engagement at some MPAs is low, these MPAs could be more important to small but underserved human populations in the neighboring area. This is a key benefit of the MLPA’s spacing requirements, which mandated that California’s MPAs be placed within 50-100 km of each other (Saarman & Carr, 2013 ) . This spacing ensures that coastal populations have relatively similar access to MPAs along the entire California coast. Thus, while MPAs in low population areas have lower engagement, the people living in these areas have opportunities for access similar to people living in higher population areas. Furthermore, MPAs also aim to achieve conservation and fisheries benefits and MPAs with low human engagement can be critical contributors to these goals. This is especially true given that human engagement with MPAs has the potential to negatively impact ecosystem function and MPA performance (Milazzo et al., 2002 ) . Furthermore, limiting human engagement can reduce the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on MPAs, including climate change, eutrophication, and pollution (Mach et al., 2017 ) . MPAs with low human engagement are thus key in the design of effective MPA networks, as they can buffer or offset the impacts of human activities in MPAs with greater engagement and limit cumulative impacts in a multi-stressor environment. A network of MPAs, like that in California, provides the opportunity to design individual MPAs that meet differing criteria and perspectives regarding human-nature relationships (Pereira et al., 2020) while contributing to overall network performance across a range of axes. The methodological framework developed here presents a useful starting point for assessing human engagement in any MPA network. To start, the iNaturalist and eBird citizen science programs already have wide global coverage and REEF has high participation in many regions. Other social media platforms, such as Instagram, Twitter, and Flickr, may also be used to assess how, when, and where people engage in MPAs (Retka et al., 2019; Tenkanen et al., ). However, these indicators do not capture all types of human engagement or all of the information needed to understand the ecological impacts of human engagement or the equity of engagement amongst different human populations. Notably, our indicators do not capture information on: (1) user demographics, which are key for understanding equality in access ( Nicholls & Shafer, 2001 ) ; (2) activities that have negative ecological impacts, such as anchoring (Creed & Amado Filho, 1999 ) ; or (3) money spent on licenses, entry fees, food, gas, and lodging, among other expenses associated with human engagement in MPAs, which are helpful in quantifying the broader impact of MPAs to local economies (Sala et al., 2013 ) . Furthermore, the types of engagement evaluated here, especially engagement in science and tourism, likely undercount underserved and disadvantaged communities, as the geoscientific community remains largely white (Dutt, 2020) and the expense of tourism and even coastal parking can be a barrier to engagement. Notably, our analysis does not explicitly account for tribal and indigenous engagement with MPAs, which is an important consideration for California’s MPA network. In addition, some of our datasets have known biases. For example, iNaturalist observations require the use of a smartphone, which may exclude some user groups. Understanding the ability and enabling conditions for MPAs to achieve human engagement objectives is important as entities around the world aim to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 to meet objectives for people and nature (CBD, 2021 ) . This paper presents a transferable framework for evaluating human engagement with MPA networks and our analyses indicate that human engagement can potentially be increased by placing or developing MPAs near people in concert with existing land-based attractions or amenities. Critical next steps in MPA and human engagement research are to identify strategies for designing MPA networks to promote equitable human engagement, capturing the full extent and value of MPAs in promoting recreation and tourism, education and outreach, and scientific research, and minimizing negative impacts of engagement on the conservation and fisheries objectives.

Marine partially protected areas: Drivers of ecological effectiveness. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 16 ( 7 ) , 381–387. https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.1934 Tables & Figures Figure 1. Maps illustrating (A) California’s marine protected area (MPA) network and (B) nearby human population density. In (A ) , greens indicate state MPAs established by the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA ) , oranges indicate state MPA designations excluded from the analysis, and purples indicate federal MPAs excluded from the analysis. See Section 2.1 and Table S1 for the definition of each MPA designation. Point size indicates MPA area (km2 ) . Dark horizontal lines delineate the four primary MLPA regions (labeled with month of implementation ) . MPAs in the San Francisco Bay region were established before 2007 and were not part of the MLPA planning effort. MPAs in the Northern Channel Islands were also established before MLPA ( 2003 and 2007 in state and federal waters, respectively) but have been officially incorporated into the network. The thin gray line indicates state waters (3 nautical miles offshore ) . In (B ) , point size indicates the number of people living within 50 km of each MPA. Colors indicate population density by census block in the 2010 U.S. Census. A few key coastal cities are labeled for reference. Figure 2. Maps illustrating six indicators of human engagement in California’s state marine protected area (MPA) network. Multiple metrics are used to measure engagement for each indicator; see Table S3 for definitions of these metrics. Across indicators, larger symbols and deeper colors indicate higher engagement. In C-F, black x’s mark MPAs without any reported engagement. Dark horizontal lines delineate the four MLPA regions. See Figure S17 for a map of the regulatory citations indicator. Figure 3. A synthesis of human engagement indicators within California’s state marine protected areas (MPAs ) . MPAs are sorted by population density within 50 km (first column of each plot) within each region. Engagement indicators are centered on the average of each indicator and scaled to unit variance to ease comparison across indicators; thus, color indicates the number of standard deviations (SDs) from the mean where blue shades indicate MPAs with above average engagement and red shades indicate MPAs with below average engagement. Gray indicates MPAs without data and x’s indicate MPAs with true zeros. MPAs with greater ( “charismatic”) and less (“underutilized”) engagement than expected based on surrounding population density are marked in the population size column. See Table S3 for definitions and metrics of the displayed indicators. Figure 4. Cumulative contributions of individual marine protected areas (MPAs) to network-wide engagement based on several indicators of human engagement. The diagonal dashed line indicates a theoretical accumulation curve in which individual protected areas contribute equally to engagement within the overall network. Curved lines above this reference line indicate accumulation curves in which some protected areas make larger contributions (higher performers) to network-wide engagement than others (lower performers ) ; the steeper the curve, the more network-wide engagement is dominated by a few protected areas. The accumulation curve for population size (dotted black line) provides an additional frame of reference: if human engagement were proportional to population size, engagement would accumulate according to this curve. Thus, curves steeper than this line indicate that benefits are more concentrated than would be predicted by population density (i.e., engagement is more selective) whereas curves shallower than this line indicate a more even distribution of benefits than would be predicted by population density (i.e., engagement is less selective ) . The MPA Watch indicators are excluded because they are not available for all MPAs within the network. Figure 5. Correlation between human engagement in an MPA and the number of people living within 50 km of the area. Human engagement is measured as the number of iNaturalist observers submitting observations within 100 m of an MPA from 2012 through 2021. The gray line and 95% confidence interval illustrate a linear regression (r2=0.14; p < 0.001) fit to all points. Blue points with residuals greater than 75% of the fitted values were classified as “charismatic” MPAs, whose engagement is higher than would be expected based on population density. Red points with residuals less than 75% of the fitted values were classified as “underutilized” MPAs, whose engagement is lower than would be expected based on population density. The charismatic and selected underutilized MPAs are labeled with their abbreviated names. The green line and 95% confidence interval illustrate a linear regression (r2=0.62; p < 0.001) fit to the “typical” protected areas (green points ) , whose engagement is largely determined by population density. Figure 6. Marginal effects of significant predictors of “charismatic” (top row) and “underutilized” ( bottom row) MPAs as identified through stepwise logistic regression. Marginal effects represent the predicted probability when varying the variable of interest while fixing the other variables at their means. Shading depicts 95% confidence intervals. See Table S5 for the list of predictors included in each model and Table S7 for the results of each model fit. Figure 7. The level of human engagement in marine protected areas (MPAs) compared to nonMPA counterfactuals for indicators with the required data. Log-response ratios were calculated after adding 1 to the engagement values occurring in both the numerator and denominator to avoid non-finite values. Log-response ratios greater than zero indicate MPAs where the MPA designation is associated with higher engagement relative to the counterfactual whereas ratios less than zero indicate MPAs where the MPA designation is associated with lower engagement relative to the counterfactual. Asterisks indicate indicators whose mean response ratio is significantly different from zero (* p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05 ) . P-values are shown parenthetically. In the boxplots, the solid line indicates the median, the box indicates the interquartile range (IQR; 25th to 75th percentiles ) , the whiskers indicate 1.5 times the IQR, and the points beyond the whiskers indicate outliers. Points represent log-response ratios for each MPA and counterfactual pair. Supplemental Tables & Figures Figure S1.

Maps of the social vulnerability indicator used to calculate the social vulnerability index by California US Census tract. Figure S3. Distribution of the social vulnerability indicator values by California US Census tract used to calculate the social vulnerability index. Values were centered on the statewide average and scaled to unit variance. Indicators in which higher vulnerability is indicated by higher values ( e.g., percent of families below poverty level, percent of households with cash public assistance income) were multiplied by -1 so that higher vulnerability is represented as low values for all indicators. The social vulnerability index, mapped in Figure S4, was calculated as the average of the centered, scaled, and standardized indicators. Figure S4. Social vulnerability index by US Census tract (polygons on land) and average social vulnerability index within 50 km of each MPA (points at sea ) . The social vulnerability index is calculated as the average of the 12 indicators of social vulnerability described in Table S2. Indicators were centered on their statewide average and scaled to unit variance before the index was calculated. Negative (red) values indicate higher social vulnerability and positive ( blue) values indicate lower social vulnerability. Figure S5.

Indicator and source Description Metrics Limitations MPA Watch ( www.mpawatch.org) Recreation: MPA Watch is a community science program that trains volunteers to observe and collect data on human uses of protected areas (MPA Watch, 2022b ) . Volunteers use a standardized survey protocol (MPA Watch, 2022a) to record consumptive (e.g., fishing) and nonconsumptive (e.g., surfing, boating, tidepooling, running, etc.) activities occurring offshore and onshore of coastal sampling sites. ( 1) the median number of activities observed per hour for surveys in which activities were observed (i.e., zeroes excluded ) ; (2) percent of surveys in which an activity was observed There is limited ability to infer the legality of the consumptive activity observed by MPA Watch volunteers because some MPAs allow some forms of harvest and MPA Watch volunteers, while well-trained, are not legal authorities on MPA boundaries and regulations. iNaturalist ( www.inaturalist.org) Recreation/education: iNaturalist is a weband app-based platform that allows observers to submit wildlife photos for identification by amateur and professional naturalists ( iNaturalist, 2022 ) . ( 1) number of iNaturalist users who submitted observations; ( 2) number of submitted observations Participation in iNaturalist largely depends on smartphone ownership and fluency and likely represents a biased ( younger, wealthier) demographic. eBird ( www.ebird.org) Recreation/education: eBird is a global citizen science program that collates observations of birds submitted by birdwatchers (eBird, 2022 ) . ( 1) number of eBird users who submitted observations; (2) number of submitted observations Participation in eBird is eased by smartphone ownership and fluency and likely represents a biased (younger, wealthier) demographic. REEF ( www.reef.org) Recreation/education: REEF is an international marine conservation organization that trains volunteer divers and ( 1) number of surveys conducted; (2) number of years in which a survey was The REEF Program is based in southern California and trainings are largely conducted snorkelers to collect and report information on marine fish and selected invertebrate and algae species (REEF, 2022 ) . conducted in this area. As a result, participation is greatly biased towards southern California. Scientific permits ( CA Dept. Fish & Wildlife) Scientific research: Permits issued by CDFW for scientific research provide an indicator of scientific research activity throughout California’s MPA network. ( 1) number of permits issued; ( 2) number of years in which permits were issued. There are no apparent limitations to this dataset. Law enforcement citations ( CA Dept. Fish & Wildlife) Non-compliance: Regulatory citations from CDFW’s Law Enforcement Division provide an indicator of where non-compliance occurs throughout California’s MPA network. ( 1) number of citations issued; ( 2) number of years in which citations were issued. The lack of effort information ( e.g., number of patrol hours) associated with the citation frequency data limits ability to infer non-compliance rates. For example, high frequency could reflect either greater enforcement activity or greater illegal activity. Table S4. Human use activities recorded by MPA Watch volunteers. Table S5.

Abstract . Climate change is impacting marine ecosystems and their goods and services in diverse ways, which can directly hinder our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs ) , set out under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. . Through expert elicitation and a literature review, we find that most climate change effects have a wide variety of negative consequences across marine eco‐ system services, though most studies have highlighted impacts from warming and consequences of marine species. . Climate change is expected to negatively influence marine ecosystem services through global stressors—such as ocean warming and acidification—but also by amplifying local and regional stressors such as freshwater runoff and pollution load. . Experts indicated that all SDGs would be overwhelmingly negatively affected by these climate impacts on marine ecosystem services, with eliminating hunger being among the most directly negatively affected SDG. . Despite these challenges, the SDGs aiming to transform our consumption and production practices and develop clean energy systems are found to be least af‐ fected by marine climate impacts. These findings represent a strategic point of | People and Nature
SINGH et al. | INTRODUCTION
The ocean provides a variety of functions that benefit people (Palumbi et al., 2009; Peterson & Lubchenco, 1997 ) , and ocean sustainability can promote all aspects of sustainable development, as represented in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs; Singh et al., 2018 ) . A healthy ocean can benefit people through a range of mechanisms such as providing raw materials and food sources (Pauly, Christensen, Dalsgaard, Froese, & Torres, 1998 ) , regulating local climates (Charlson, Lovelock, Andreae, & Warren, 1987 ) , providing development and em‐ ployment opportunities (Golden et al., 2017) and providing places sacred to different cultural groups (Oviedo & Jeanrenaud, 2007 ) . However, climate change is projected to alter marine ecosystems in complex ways which can affect the benefits people derive from the ocean, such as altering marine food webs and rising sea levels (Doney et al., 2011; Harley et al., 2006 ) . In an era of unprecedented global change, understanding how climate change is altering the connections between marine ecosystems and the benefits they contribute to peo‐ ple are imperative. In this paper, we review the effect that climate change has on the oceans and identify how these effects translate to progress towards and ultimately our ability to achieve the SDGs.
Marine ecosystem services, the ecological processes that render benefits to people,1 face a broad array of risks from climate change, including ocean acidification (which is specific to marine systems ) , changes to temperature, precipitation, storm frequency and variation, UV radiation, as well as changes to pH and sea level (Doney et al., ; Halpern et al., 2008; Harley et al., 2006 ) . Coastal areas are home to a large proportion of the global human population (McGranahan, Balk, & Anderson, 2007; Neumann, Vafeidis, Zimmermann, & Nicholls, ), and many small island states are among the world's least devel‐ oped countries while being highly dependent on marine ecosystem services (Guillaumont, 2010 ) . Thus, marine ecosystems and ecosystem services are an important link between climate change and the SDGs.
The SDGs go beyond the desire to simply end poverty and envi‐ ronmental degradation and instead establish goals for a ‘future we want’ (UN, 2015 ) . The SDGs are wide ranging, including goals for poverty alleviation (SDG 1 ) , eliminating hunger (SDG 2) and improv‐ ing health (SDG 3 ) , ensuring minimum education standards (SDG 4 ) , reducing inequalities for women (SDG 5) and marginalized groups ( SDG 10 ) , enhancing access to clean water (SDG 6) and energy sources (SDG 7 ) , economic growth and job creation (SDG 8 ) , making infrastructure (SDG 9) and cities (SDG 11) environmentally sustain‐ able, restructuring supply and consumption systems (SDG 12 ) , con‐ serving and sustainably using marine (SDG 14) and terrestrial (SDG ) systems, and enhancing policy coherence and partnerships (SDG ), rule of law (SDG 16) and creating regulations for climate change minimization and adaptation (SDG 13 ) .
While research and policy attention on the SDGs have mainly focused on the interrelationships of the SDGs (Le Blanc, 2015; Nilsson et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018 ) , and policy priorities to ad‐ vance specific or a suite of SDGs (Blanchard et al., 2017; Griggs et al., 2013 ) , there is a nascent understanding of how our changing world is affecting our ability to achieve the SDGs to begin with. While important advances have been made in exploring the con‐ sequences of climate change on fisheries (Cheung et al., 2010; Cheung, Reygondeau, & Frölicher, 2016; Sumaila, Cheung, Lam, Pauly, & Herrick, 2011 ) , our understanding of the implications of climate change effects on the oceans regarding the SDGs is inade‐ quate. Moreover, climate change has wide‐reaching effects across ecosystems, with implications for global conservation, resource management, economies and human migration patterns. The com‐ plex effects of climate change can have nonintuitive consequences for SDG attainment. Will climate change's effects on increasing fish growth rates help make SDG 2 (ending hunger) more achievable, or will the increased climatic variability and shifting range sizes make SDG 2 less achievable? Will sea level rise reduce our ability for in‐ clusive, safe and environmentally sustainable coastal development or expand it? According to the Strategic Sustainable Development framework, planning towards sustainability requires not only an understanding of desired goals, but a rigorous assessment of While we acknowledge that there are many ways to conceptualize the relationship of people with the environment (Diaz, et al. 2018 ) , the ecosystem service framing allows us to systematically address human‐environment relationships in ways that are conducive to much of the academic literature (Lele, et al. 2013 ) . entry for countries to achieve sustainable development, given that these two goals are relatively robust to climate impacts and that they are important pre‐requisite for other SDGs. . Our results suggest that climate change impacts on marine ecosystems are set to make the SDGs a moving target travelling away from us. Effective and urgent action towards sustainable development, including mitigating and adapting to climate impacts on marine systems are important to achieve the SDGs, but the longer this action stalls the more distant these goals will become.

SINGH et al. current conditions in relation to desired goals in order to determine sequential policy priorities to achieve desired goals (Broman & Robèrt, 2017 ) . Climate change is effectively changing the baseline from which we act to achieve the SDGs (Beg et al., 2002) and cli‐ mate change may not affect our ability to achieve the SDGs equally. Determining which SDGs are likely more or less affected by cli‐ mate change can aide policy‐makers in determining which SDGs are more currently attainable and should be prioritized as entry points to eventually achieve the SDGs broadly.
Here, using a combination of literature review and expert elici‐ tation methods, we ask two questions: (a) How does climate change affect marine ecosystem services? and (b) What is the relationship between climate‐impacted marine ecosystem services and our abil‐ ity to achieve SDGs? | MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used an ecosystem services framework to understand how cli‐ mate change impacts on ocean and marine ecosystems may affect our ability to achieve the SDGs. As climate change is known to have a variety of environmental consequences, an ecosystem services ap‐ proach allowed us to tie climate change impacts with SDGs, since ecosystem services directly tie environmental dynamics to human well‐being (Lele, Springate‐Baginski, Lakerveld, Deb, & Dash, 2013 ) . First, we conducted a scoping literature review to identify the known and predicted consequences of climate change on marine ecosystem services along four broad categories of ecosystem services (provi‐ sioning, regulating, habitat and supporting and cultural services ) . Second, we conducted a hierarchical expert elicitation process to identify kinds of relationships between impacted marine ecosystem services and the main targets in 16 of the 17 SDGs. Our approach is visualized in Figure 1 below. .1 | Climate change impacts on marine ecosystem services
In order to assess the consequences of climate change impacts on marine ecosystem services, we conducted a scoping review of the literature (Miller, Ota, Sumaila, Cisneros‐Montemayor, & Cheung, ). We relied on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB) framework of ecosystem services classification (http://www.
FI G U R E 1 Methodological framework of relating the cascading effects of climate change on ecosystem services and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs ) . Our investigation into the impact of climate change on sustainable development uses (a) scoping literature review to outline identified relationships between climate change and marine ecosystem services and (b) expert elicitation to evaluate the kinds of relationships from impacted marine ecosystem services (identified in a) on our ability to achieve the SDGs. Ecosystem service categories are based on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) and sustainable development categories as defined by the SDGs. Our analysis explores the links (arrows) identified by (a) and (b ) . The arrows are not meant to be exhaustive, but representative of potential links.

SINGH et al. teebw eb.org/resou rces/ecosy stem‐servi ces/, de Groot, Fisher, &. Christie, 2010) to systematically and comprehensively review cli‐ mate impacts on marine ecosystem services (Table S1 ) .
Our scoping methods involved searching Google Scholar and ISI Web of Knowledge for relevant articles detailing the kinds of climate impacts on the various ecosystem services. We limited our search to articles, including review articles, past 2013 as this was the cut‐off year for the previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC) report and we reviewed IPCC reports and review articles. The recent IPCC report (AR5) represents the most comprehensive understanding of climate change up to that point (IPCC, 2014 ) , and so reviewing articles past the IPCC cut‐off year (including review ar‐ ticles that outline impacts identified before that year) allowed us to update the latest comprehensive understanding of climate change impacts without duplicating effort. We used a series of search terms ( Table S1) to conduct our literature review. The search terms in‐ cluded terms for all ecosystem services classification, as well as the terms ‘climate impacts’ and ‘climate change impacts’.
In accordance with literature review methods to retrieve infor‐ mation from peer‐reviewed articles, systematic searches were car‐ ried out with the terms in Table S1 strategically chosen to retrieve mechanisms linking climate change to a comprehensive set of marine ecosystem services (Miller et al., 2018 ) . Searches were conducted to find the terms anywhere in the articles. For each set of search terms, the estimated top 80% (or higher) of papers were reviewed ( see below for how we determined the number of papers to review ) . After screening the title and abstract for relevance, the text of the paper was read to determine the ecosystem service it describes im‐ pacts on, and determine the mechanisms by which climate change is affecting the various marine ecosystem services.
To ensure that we consulted a majority of the literature for each ecosystem service, we used an empirical standard. First, we found the ecosystem service with the largest number of papers in the search engines. Within that ecosystem service, we reviewed and recorded the number of relevant papers until we found a search page without any relevant papers. We determined the number of search pages we would have to review to capture 80% of the total relevant papers and used that as our common search limit across all ecosystem service categories. This process led us reviewing the top pages of the search engines for each ecosystem service, and be‐ cause our standard was taken from the ecosystem service with the greatest number of papers, we likely captured >80% of the relevant papers for all other ecosystem services. Across all marine ecosystem services, we reviewed 142 papers. Specifically, we reviewed five papers addressing impacts on marine aesthetics, two papers ad‐ dressing impacts on marine biological control, 11 papers addressing impacts on carbon sequestration and storage, 19 papers addressing impacts on erosion prevention, 35 papers addressing impacts on marine food sources, six papers addressing impacts on fresh water in coastal systems, eight papers addressing impacts on marine habitat, six papers addressing impacts on local climate, 21 papers addressing impacts on marine genetic biodiversity, three papers addressing impacts on medicinal resources, four papers addressing impacts on extreme event moderation, 15 papers addressing im‐ pacts on marine recreation and health, five papers addressing im‐ pacts on spiritual experience and sense of place in marine systems, seven papers addressing impacts on marine tourism and one paper addressing impacts across all ecosystem services.
Once all papers were collected and reviewed, we summarized the variety of ways that climate change impacts ecosystem ser‐ vices and recorded the direction of change (negative or positive impact ) . From each reviewed paper, we recorded the mechanism of impact, the direction of climate effects on the ecosystem ser‐ vice (either positive or negative) relative to current conditions, the spatial scope of the effect, the kind of study and the marine eco‐ system type where the impact was recorded. We structured our data collection with a pathways of effects model, according to the following structure:
General Climate Change Stressor → Impact Mechanism → Ecosystem Service Category
A pathways of effects model includes general climate stressors lead‐ ing to impact mechanisms that link the general stressors with the ecosystem services (sensu Singh et al., 2017a, 2017b ) . The purpose of such pathways of effects models is to create transparent and general structure for characterizing impact in a systematic way. For our study, general climate stressors were determined by consulting the peer‐re‐ viewed literature on environmental impact frameworks which system‐ atically categorize and quantify climate effects (Halpern et al., 2015, , 2008; Teck et al., 2010 ) . The categories from these frameworks were then pared down by determining which categories adequately described the impacts on ecosystem services identified in our litera‐ ture review. The final list of general climate stressors included: warm‐ ing, extreme weather, precipitation change, sea level rise, acidification and various simultaneous stressors. The specific impacts outlined in the papers were coded to group similar mechanisms together; how‐ ever, within each set of grouped mechanisms, we retained the count of the specific impacts. For example, if two papers described how ocean warming led to species loss, but one paper outlined loss in a fish species and the other a loss in a bivalve, we recorded that as two impacts under the same mechanism. The list of grouped specific im‐ pacts included: bloom events, changes in chemical flows, geopolitics, oceanography, local climate, phenology, selection pressure, habitat al‐ teration, aquaculture damage, coastal squeeze, coral bleaching, mental health effects, disease transmission, species shifts and loss, individual organism effects, land‐sea interface, temperature increase, human mi‐ gration, biomass change, infrastructure damage, invasive species, live‐ lihood disruption, trophic effects, regime shift, sea ice loss and storm surges. This pathways of effects model also allowed us to use network analysis to identify which general and specific climate change stressors have been noted most frequently as affecting specific ecosystem ser‐ vices. Using this information, we generated a network of effects from climate change to the various marine ecosystem services, weighing the stressors from climate change to ecosystem services by the number of links they have across ecosystem services (Singh et al., 2017b ) . | 321

SINGH et al. .2 | Effects of impacted ecosystem services on SDGs
We conducted an expert elicitation to assess relationships between changes in marine ecosystem services from climate change (relative to current conditions) and the likely consequence this change has on our progress towards the SDGs. We chose to only review the first 16 SDGs as SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) relates to international policy cooperation and capacity building needed to achieve the other goals and is not dependent on ecosystems (Singh et al., 2018 ) . We also only chose to look at the consequences of the main targets within the SDGs (those that are numbered such as SDG 14.1) and not secondary targets (those that are lettered such as SDG 14.a) because the secondary targets do not provide temporal and thematic detail to what achievement means, requiring extra interpretation. .2.1 | Choice of experts
We solicited input from three main categories of experts to inform our study: (a) experts on ecosystem service approaches and re‐ search, (b) experts on marine ecosystem services and planning and ( c) experts on specific marine ecosystem services for ecosystem services described in our analysis. All experts were chosen based on publication record, education and experience with a particular ecosystem service and the recommendation of both the authors as well as other recognized external experts, and interest in collabo‐ rating with the study. The identification of experts required multi‐ ple steps. First, lists of potential experts were compiled by the lead authors and coordinating lead authors for the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Second, this list was corroborated and expanded by the publication record and experience. Third, we asked individuals on this list to join the study or further nominate experts. Finally, we prioritized experts who were recommended at multiple stages and whose experience best matched the particular marine ecosystem services we investigated. In the end, we elicited knowledge from 17 experts, and our com‐ piled experts represented those with training in resource policy, environmental governance, natural capital accounting and resource economics, engineering, epidemiology, biogeochemistry, coastal ecology, food security, marine conservation, fisheries management, marine biogeography, environmental sociology, environmental plan‐ ning, geography, finance, environmental social science and spiritual ecology (see Table S2 ) . .2.2 | Structured elicitation
Our structured elicitation used a modified Delphi process of iterative expert input, adapted from other approaches using email (McBride et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2018 ) . Email‐based elicitation approaches through facilitators have been shown to be effective in eliciting ex‐ pert judgements from structured processes, and have the added benefit of providing practical benefits of maintaining anonymity of experts and relative ease of logistics (McBride et al., 2012 ) . We used a hierarchical design, whereby the general expert on ecosystem ser‐ vices first provided input, then this input was given to the expert on marine ecosystem services and marine planning, who was instructed to point out areas of agreement or disagreement and this updated input is given to the topic specialists, who were again instructed to point our areas or agreement or disagreement. Experts at each stage of the elicitation were briefed on the elicitation process and spe‐ cific framework for selecting relationship types over email (McBride & Burgman, 2012; McBride et al., 2012 ) . Specifically, experts were asked to determine the relationships between climate‐impacted ecosystem services (the change to the ecosystem service caused by climate change) and the specific targets within the first 16 SDGs. Any uncertainties expressed by the experts were clarified by the as‐ sessment team.
At each stage there was embedded feedback, whereby the lat‐ ter stage expert would consider their responses by reflecting on the choices and reasoning from the prior expert. Between the first and second stage, the experts challenged their reasoning behind their decisions in an in‐person discussion, and the expert on marine eco‐ systems and ecosystem service planning had a chance to update their responses. The topic area expert was instructed to think about support for or disagreement with the submitted responses after the second stage. They were encouraged to think about the reasoning behind the responses submitted to them and provide justifications for any agreement or disagreement, and provide relevant literature to support their conclusions. Experts from earlier stages were then allowed to view these responses, discuss over email and the topic experts then provided their final responses. By asking successive stages of experts to agree or disagree with prior stages, and base their reasoning on mechanistic understanding of the relationship, we used informative inputs to guide the elicitation and focused the sub‐ sequent elicitations to challenge and provide structured reasoning behind their assessments—both of which have been demonstrated to increase the performance of experts (Singh et al., 2017a; 2017b ) . This hierarchical design is based on a recognition of uneven weight‐ ing of expert responses (whereby, specialist knowledge is weighted heavier for the particular marine ecosystem service corresponding to their expertize) and expertize is refined through iteration, in‐ creased specific knowledge and embedded expert discussions and challenges to their judgements (McBride & Burgman, 2012; Morgan, ). This iterative elicitation strategy using email, feedback and justified reasoning is designed to minimize predictable biases such as dominance, overconfidence, framing effects, availability and linguis‐ tic uncertainty (Burgman et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2012; McBride & Burgman, 2012; Morgan, 2014; Singh et al., 2017a; 2017b ) . .2.3 | Decision structure
The structured protocol follows a hierarchical decision process to characterize relationships (sensu Singh et al., 2018 ) , resulting in one of the eight different relationships. At each stage, experts were asked to consider which option was most likely. The first step in the process is determining if a relationship exists. If the expert decides | People and Nature
SINGH et al. that a relationship exists, then they were tasked with determining if the relationship is positive to the SDG target, negative or either. If positive or negative relationships were chosen, experts were tasked with identifying if the relationship is proximal (where climate‐im‐ pacted ecosystem services have a proximal causal relationship with the impact on the SDG target) or distal (where climate‐impacted ecosystem services have distal relationship with the impact on the SDG target ) . Impacts on marine ecosystem services can have both proximal and distal relationships across SDGs. Negative impacts on fish populations can have proximate consequences for ocean con‐ servation goals, particularly related to fisheries (SDG 14) but more distal effects for poverty reduction (SDG 1 ) , because the relation‐ ships depend on people's dependence on fish for food and income, and the ability to catch fish. As a further example of a distal relation‐ ship, having enough food can contribute to the stability needed for inclusive participation in decision‐making (SDG 16.7 ) , but there are many social and political factors that are more proximate that may regulate whether inclusive participation occurs. If proximal relation‐ ships were chosen, then experts were tasked with determining if the relationship was direct or indirect (the relationship is mediated through a third variable ) . The decision process is outlined in Figure 2 and described in Table S3. Examples are shown in Figure S1.
Experts were instructed to consider relationships at a global spa‐ tial scale and to consider the temporal scale embedded in the SDG targets. For the global scale, experts were asked to consider the ag‐ gregate response across the planet, meaning that if sometimes an adverse impact on ecosystem services is associated positively with an SDG target but most of the time the association is negative, they should choose a negative relationship. For example, if ending hun‐ ger across the planet requires intact habitats for food species de‐ spite the fact that at a particular national scale food acquisition may not be tied to functional habitats, adverse impacts on habitats for species would have a negative‐proximal‐indirect relationship with SDG 2.1 (ensuring sufficient food to all people ) . For temporal scale, experts were asked to consider how climate‐impacted ecosystem services are likely to affect our ability to achieve the SDG target by the given target date. Most SDG targets have target dates of 2030, with some 2020 and a few 2025. Targets without achievement dates were treated as having a date of 2030 (Singh et al., 2018 ) . If experts thought that there were different relationship dynamics in the short term (before the achievement date) compared to the longer term ( at the achievement date ) , then experts were asked to provide re‐ sponses for the short and long term. Given that decision structures cannot eliminate uncertainty (particularly linguistic uncertainty in what exactly the distinctions between categories pertain to—see Regan, Colyvan, & Burgman, 2002 ) , we asked experts to voluntarily provide justification for their choices, and these justifications were similarly reviewed by later stage experts. .2.4 | Characterizing uncertainty
We characterized three levels of certainty (low, medium, high) in expert‐defined relationships based on the degrees of support, incorporating the level of agreement between experts and any FI G U R E 2 Decision tree used to determine the kinds of relationships between impacted marine ecosystem services and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. The relationship experts were tasked with characterizing were climate‐impacted ecosystem services ( changes to ecosystem services caused by climate change) and the specific targets within the 16 analysed SDGs. The decision tree followed a four‐step series of questions. The final relationship categories are represented by bold squares | 323

SINGH et al. additional supporting literature or supporting comments provided by the topic specialist. This method of characterizing uncertainty utilizes a transparent methodology adapted from the IPCC process ( Mastrandrea et al., 2010 ) . Expert judgements agreeing with the final determination, as well as the final determination by the topic specialist, each counted as one degree of support. Each stage of expert input had the potential to contribute one degree of sup‐ port. Any supporting comments provided by the topic specialist expert also counted as one degree of support, whereas comments indicating uncertainty subtracted a degree of support, and sup‐ porting literature also counted as a degree of support. This pro‐ cess allowed for up to five degrees of support. Relationships with at least three levels of support were considered as having high confidence, while two degrees of support were considered me‐ dium confidence and having only one degree of support was con‐ sidered low confidence. The uncertainty and expert confidence framework are presented in Figure S2.
We summarized which ecosystem services, when impacted by climate change, are related across the largest number of SDG tar‐ gets for direct, indirect and supportive relationships. Similarly, we report which SDG is considered by experts to be most affected by climate effects across ecosystem services. We also identified which relationships are more certain and less certain according to experts, in order to target research. | RESULTS .1 | Climate impacts on marine ecosystem services
Across almost all marine ecosystem services, the total number of negative impacts from general climate change stressors is substan‐ tially larger than the total number of positive impacts as identified in the literature review (Table 1 ) . The only ecosystem service that did not follow this pattern was aesthetic appreciation, which had an equal number of positive and negative impacts across climate change stressors. The peer‐reviewed literature identified the most climate impact pathways on food (131 total impacts) followed by impacts on erosion prevention (44 total impacts ) . Among general climate stressors, most impacts characterized in the peer‐reviewed literature stem from increased warming (204 total impacts ) , followed by extreme events (61 total impacts ) .
Most impact pathways reported in the peer‐reviewed litera‐ ture outlined relationships from ocean warming through species shifts and loss (including extinction, biodiversity reductions and species range shifts ) , and impacts on food production (Figure 3 ) . Warming was the general climate stressor with the greatest vari‐ ety of connections to impact mechanisms (24 connections with impact mechanisms) followed by extreme weather (15 connec‐ tions with impact mechanisms ) . Precipitation change, sea level rise and acidification all had fewer than 10 connections with impact mechanisms. The effect pathway most commonly found in the lit‐ erature for ocean acidification was effects to individual organisms ( through direct mortality, reduced calcification and growth rates) affecting food production. Precipitation changes were most com‐ monly identified in the literature as operating through the land‐sea interface, affecting runoff rates and flooding and drought cycles to impact tourism. Extreme weather was most often described in the peer‐reviewed literature as increasing storm surges which de‐ graded the service of erosion prevention. Sea level rise was most often described as increasing inundation and intertidal habitat loss, negatively effecting erosion prevention functions. .2 | Consequences of negative impacts on marine ecosystem services to SDGs .2.1 | Direction of effect
The vastly negative impacts of climate change across marine ecosys‐ tem services led experts to indicate that most targets in all SDGs will most likely be negatively affected, though most of these negative ef‐ fects were thought to operate through distal mechanisms (Figure 4 ) . While many SDG targets are not immediately associated with ma‐ rine ecosystem services, there are known (as determined through identified research) and suspected (as judged by experts) indirect pathways linking climate impacts on SDG targets through marine ecosystem services. The least negatively impacted SDGs (according to the proportion of targets with negative relationships) were sus‐ tainable consumption and production (SDG 12) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7 ) .
Direct effects of climate‐impacted marine ecosystem services on SDGs were thought to occur across a minority of SDG targets. The SDGs with the largest proportion of targets directly affected were SDG 2 (eliminating hunger) and SDG 15 (life on land, or terrestrial conservation ) . Surprisingly, SDG 14 (life below water, or marine con‐ servation and management) was not one of the SDGs whose targets were thought to be most directly affected, despite our analysis of climate change on marine ecosystem services. Experts pointed to the fact that many of the targets in SDG 14 are not simply about marine conservation but about marine development and industries, which are not always directly influenced by ecosystem services but mediated through other factors.
Some SDG targets were thought to be positively influenced by climate‐impacted marine ecosystem services. Most of these identi‐ fied relationships were associated with negative impacts on genetic diversity (and some associated with other ecosystem services such as sense of place ) , whereby negative impacts on biodiversity lead to a greater sense of urgency, which can result in action taken on climate policy (e.g. SDG 13.2) and become educated on sustainable development (e.g. SDG 12.8 ) . Some other examples of positive im‐ pacts are the consequences of marine resource degradation (such as food and freshwater ) , requiring a shift to diversify economies, utilize other resources and (presumably) focus on sustainable use of these resources. SDG targets thought to be positively impacted by climate‐affected ecosystem services were mostly judged to be speculative, indirect and distal in nature, and not agreed on across experts, leading to low certainty. | People and Nature
SINGH et al.
A minority of SDG targets were determined by experts to have relationships with ecosystem services that are too uncer‐ tain to determine as positive or negative. Most of these ‘either’ relationships occurred in SDG targets that depend on human behaviour and where experts were unsure of how people would respond to a climate‐affected ecosystem service. For example, experts judged that negative impacts on carbon sequestration services could either lead to increased or decreased environmen‐ tal protection in equal probability. Similarly, experts thought that a variety of degraded ecosystem services might either increase or decrease research and innovation in relatively equal probabilities. .2.2 | Certainty of effect
The majority of expert‐identified relationships between climate‐ affected ecosystem services and SDG targets had high confidence ( 54% ) , followed by medium confidence (41%) and a minority had low confidence (5% ) . The SDGs with the highest proportion of high confidence relationships were SDG 15 (life on land, 67% ) , SDG 1 ( no poverty, 65%) and SDG 10 (reduce inequalities, 64% ) . SDG 12 ( sustainable consumption and production) had the highest propor‐ tion of targets with relationships judged with low confidence, but it was still a clear minority of cases (12.5% ) .

SINGH et al. types that experts were most certain in their judgements were aesthetic experience and inspiration for art and culture (92% of relationships had high certainty ) , and most of the relationships for this ecosystem service were distal and supporting. The other eco‐ system services with high certainty expert judgements were ero‐ sion prevention (89% high certainty ) , food (75% of relationships with high certainty) and recreation (79% of relationships with high certainty ) . By a large margin, the ecosystem service with the high‐ est proportion of low‐certainty expert judgements was genetic di‐ versity (40% of relationships with low certainty and only 17% with high certainty ) . Experts disagreed on the type of relationship and no supporting literature was known to exist explicitly linking loss in genetic diversity across the SDGs.

While this study supports previous assessments that climate change has wide ranging consequences for ecosystem services (Doney et al., 2011; Harley et al., 2006; IPCC, 2014 ) , our study reveals that FI G U R E 3 A network of pathways of effects from general climate stressors (in red on the left) through impact mechanisms (in yellow in the middle) towards marine ecosystem services (in blue on the right) compiled through literature review.

SINGH et al. these changes to marine systems are limiting our overall ability to achieve the SDGs across all goals. Though our results show that im‐ pacts of climate change on the ocean described in peer‐reviewed literature are mostly associated with warming, climate change is a multi‐dimensional, global process that changes a variety of environ‐ mental dynamics that influence the biosphere. These dynamics in‐ clude changes to precipitation (Gleick, 2014 ) , storm frequency and intensity (Spalding et al., 2014 ) , sea level rise (Arkema et al., 2013) and ocean acidification (Kroeker, Kordas, Crim, & Singh, 2010 ) . These global changes often aggravate local processes that affect the biosphere, such as runoff (Singh et al., 2017a; 2017b ) , trophic inter‐ actions (Edwards & Richardson, 2004 ) , habitat alteration (Battin et al., 2007 ) , phenological shifts (Edwards & Richardson, 2004 ) , range shifts (Cheung et al., 2009 ) , size changes due to metabolic effects and oxygen limitation (Cheung et al., 2013; Pauly & Cheung, 2018 ) , calcified structure dissolution (Kroeker et al., 2010) and others.

SINGH et al. fact, our results show that there is a range of climate change effects that alter local environmental conditions, such as circulation and habitat structure (Bauer et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014 ) , and therefore indirectly affect ecosystem services.
Our review also reveals that climate change impacts have been documented to affect people directly through disruption of liveli‐ hoods, such as increasing costs of acquiring fish when they move, and having mental health impacts, such as increasing the risk of psychological distress from natural disasters (Bourque & Cunsolo Willox, 2014; Hunt et al., 2016 ) . Though the peer‐reviewed literature does identify some positive impacts of climate change to ecosystem services, such as increasing growth rates of food species (Myers et al., 2017 ) , our results indicate that there are more negative conse‐ quences of climate change across ecosystem services. Though this result does not account for the magnitude of positive vs. negative impacts, our results indicate that seven of the 16 ecosystem service categories have no positive impacts from climate change, and our experts unanimously agreed that climate change will have generally negative consequences across marine ecosystem services. Through the determination of negative relationships between climate‐im‐ pacted marine ecosystem services and SDGs, as well as the relative high confidence in these determinations, our study highlights not just the importance of considering climate change in our ability to achieve the SDGs, but also supports earlier findings about the im‐ portance of marine systems towards the SDGs (Singh et al., 2018 ) .
The majority of SDG targets are, or likely will be, detrimentally affected by climate changes to marine ecosystem services. There are a minority of SDG targets that experts thought would be unaffected by global climate change, and there are very few changes that are positive. Other studies have determined that some areas of the world are likely to experience these consequences less than others (Patz, Campbell‐Lendrum, Holloway, & Foley, 2005; Wheeler & Von Braun, ), and so may benefit in a relative, geopolitical way. For exam‐ ple, Norway's fisheries may not suffer as much (or even benefit) as countries farther south, whose endemic fish are migrating poleward ( Cheung et al., 2010 ) . Despite these relative ‘winners’ in a climate change future, the SDGs include goals and targets focused on justice and reducing global inequalities (UN, 2015 ) . The fact that the ‘losers’ in climate change are projected to be the global south and equatorial countries, where vulnerabilities are disproportionately high, signals that beyond the specific targets of the SDGs, climate change is detri‐ mentally affecting our ability to achieve the spirit of the SDGs.
The relationships between climate‐impacts on marine ecosystem services and SDGs, as determined by experts, were far‐reaching, even affecting targets often associated as being ‘economic’ or ‘social’ targets. Most targets directly affected by climate‐impacted marine ecosystem services were those targets associated with primary in‐ dustries (i.e. natural resource extraction) and conservation, where the link to natural ecosystems is straightforward, such as SDG 2 (no hunger ) , and SDG 15 (life on land ) . Impacts on other SDGs were con‐ sidered more distal in nature, where impacted ecosystems are me‐ diated through social and economic factors first before affecting an SDG target. For example, experts suggested that erosion amplified by climate change can negatively influence our abilities to sustain‐ ably manage chemical use and their release into the water (SDG .4 ) . Erosion will negatively affect soil productivity, which experts suggest will likely increase people's reliance on chemical fertilizers and increase the risk of over‐application (Jie, Jing‐Zhang, Man‐Zhi, & Zi‐tong, 2002 ) , leading to increased water contamination through runoff. Similarly, experts suggested that climate impacts that nega‐ tively influence natural biological control can make local food sys‐ tems and other provisioning services less stable, and people may respond by migrating (Black et al., 2011 ) , making the SDG target of facilitating safe and orderly migration harder to achieve (SDG 10.7 ) .
While the risk of negative impacts on many SDG targets is height‐ ened with negative changes to ecosystem services, the experts did point out that people's actions would determine the final effect on SDGs where distal relationships exist, and social and economic vari‐ ables were more proximal to the SDG target. Our analytical frame‐ work tasked experts with assessing whether positive or negative (or neither) effects to SDG targets are more probable as a result of climate change impacts on marine ecosystem services. When experts iden‐ tified distal relationships, they were cautious in their conclusions. In fact, experts often hedged their explanations of how people would react to ecosystem service change, using words like ‘may’ and ‘could’, and suggested in discussion that even though the changes to an eco‐ system service may influence progress towards (or away from) an SDG target, people's actions may nevertheless lead to a different outcome. The contextual nature of many relationships, where social and eco‐ nomic factors regulate the relationship between ecosystem services and SDGs, challenge some prominent models of sustainable develop‐ ment which treat social and economic factors as embedded within and dependent on environmental factors (Griggs et al., 2013 ) , and other models which treat environment, social and economic factors as lin‐ early and sequentially related (Reid et al., 2017 ) . Instead, we find that even in situations where the environment can be a catalyst to develop‐ ment issues, social and economic factors were still controlling levers. Previous studies on ocean protection concluded that environmental goals are dependent on social and economic factors such as staff pres‐ ence and budget capacity and community buy‐in (Christie, 2004; Gill et al., 2017 ) . Furthermore, a previous study has found that targets that incorporate environmental, social and economic dimensions simulta‐ neously (rather than prioritizing the environment) are pre‐requisites across the greatest number of SDG targets, and focusing on economic capacity that can contribute to social and environmental programs can be most beneficial across the SDGs (Singh et al., 2018 ) .
The role of social and economic dimensions in regulating the re‐ lationship between climate‐impacted ecosystem services and SDGs is also important in many of the positive effects experts identified. Many of these positive effects relied on optimistic interpretations of the future, whereby impacts on ecosystem services yielded pro‐sus‐ tainable behaviour by people. For example, some experts thought that impacts on genetic diversity could yield greater attention paid to sustainability education (SDG 4.7) as people will be confronted with more degraded ecosystems, and problem awareness can con‐ tribute to (but is not sufficient for) environmental action (Bamberg | People and Nature
SINGH et al.
& Möser, 2007 ) . Many of these positive effects are not guaranteed, and they were often a result of lower certainty expert categoriza‐ tions. Indeed, degraded ecosystems can become normalized which can lead to complacency or a shift in priorities (Clavero, 2014 ) . Additionally, many of the relationships classified as ‘either’ by ex‐ perts, which include the possibility for positive and negative effects and are inherently uncertain, also scored lower on the certainty scale. Despite these caveats, our findings do suggest that people can potentially respond in positive ways towards the SDGs in the face of climate change. This research evaluated impacts based on current contexts and understanding and was not designed to capture human ingenuity and innovation in the face of climate change, but that is an important next step for this research theme.
The uncertain connections between climate‐impacted marine ecosystem services and SDGs are broader than the potential posi‐ tives we discuss above. Many potential negative consequences of cli‐ mate impacts on marine ecosystem services were also considered to have low certainty from our expert elicitation process. Particularly, the consequences of climate change to genetic diversity to SDGs were most frequently determined with low certainty. The lack of published literature documenting the welfare consequences of a loss of biodiversity in general was credited with this low certainty by the topic specific expert. In some cases, more certainty could be gained through more targeted research, at smaller scales (such as determining whether and under what conditions loss of ecosystem services leads to pro‐sustainable motivations and actions ) . However, many of the uncertainties are also a consequence of the fact that the assessment considers the consequences of different dimensions of well‐being in the future (most SDGs have target dates of 2030 ) . Assessments of the future carry inherent uncertainty that are some‐ times not mitigated through further study. Simultaneously, the scale of consequences from climate change to biodiversity (and other marine ES) cannot easily be simulated with current scientific meth‐ ods, meaning that some of the uncertainty in our results cannot be practically reduced, especially not while urgent action on the SDGs is needed. In spite of the uncertainty, we recommend taking a pre‐ cautionary approach, and not treat the uncertainty in the assessment as a justification to ignore the potential consequences of climate im‐ pacts on marine ecosystem services. Strategically, this assessment can serve as a first iteration and set of recommendations for engag‐ ing the SDGs, and follow‐up assessments over time can provide up‐ dated recommendations.
We are not suggesting that progress on the SDGs is impossi‐ ble, despite the fact that climate change can be safely assumed to worsen in the future (IPCC, 2014 ) . We are, however, suggesting that climate change is affecting the SDGs so that these global goals are a moving target, travelling away from us. Achieving the SDGs will require a renewed and immediate commitment, including towards minimizing climate change impacts. This commitment will require cooperative action, especially in cases where climate change will entrench and worsen disparities (poverty—SDG 1, hunger—SDG 2, inequalities—SDG 10 ) . Despite the negative consequences that cli‐ mate change presents, it offers a motive, urgency and opportunity for concerted global action. Based on our analysis, a strategic point of entry for countries around the world to achieve the SDGs could be addressing sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) since they are potentially less vulnerable to climate change impacts (proportionately they have the fewest negatively affected targets from climate change ) . Coincidently, they are also SDGs that are important means towards the ends of the other SDGs, and also towards limiting climate change (Nerini et al., 2018 ) . Whether climate change will limit our ability to cooperatively achieve the SDGs or it serves as a cata‐ lyst for change is still an open question, but the longer we wait to achieve the SDGs the more distant they will become.

Abstract . Alien species can be damaging to native biodiversity, human well- being and the economy. Identifying the complete range of impacts they cause, and the ways that these impacts are connected, may inform the prioritisation of management actions to mitigate impacts. . Using datasets on the biodiversity impacts and monetary costs (damage and management costs) of alien birds, we aimed to establish whether species with the most severe biodiversity impacts also had the highest costs; whether types of biodiversity impact were associated with high costs; and whether specific factors associated with alien species are linked to both damaging biodiversity impacts and high costs. . We identified a positive relationship between a specific type of biodiversity impact (predation) and costs, possibly because predation by alien birds can be severely damaging to native species and therefore attracts management actions. However, predation impacts are likely to occur more frequently and to be easier to identify than some other impact mechanisms such as hybridisation and transmission of diseases, and they are therefore likely to be more frequently managed and hence to have costs. . We identified a specific species characteristic (generalism) to be associated with severe biodiversity impacts and high costs, probably because generalist species have greater opportunity to cause impacts, whether they be on biodiversity or the economy, or both. We also found widely distributed alien birds to be associated with high costs, probably because these species also have greater opportunity to cause impacts.

EVANS et al. | INTRODUCTION
A species is considered to be alien when it has been introduced by people to regions of the world where it would not naturally occur ( Blackburn et al., 2011 ) . If an alien species has damaging impacts, it is considered to be invasive (IUCN, 2023 ) . Invasive alien species are one of the five main causes of declining biodiversity across the globe, and they can adversely affect human well- being, in particular by hindering economic development and compromising human health (Díaz et al., 2019 ) .
There are over 400 alien bird species with self- sustaining populations worldwide (Dyer et al., 2017 ) , and some have unwanted impacts on nature and people (Evans et al., 2016, 2020 ) . Impacts that affect nature include competition with native species for resources and predation of native species as a source of food (MartinAlbarracin et al., 2015 ) . Impacts that affect people include the consumption of agricultural crops, damage to aircraft caused by bird strikes at airports, and fouling of public buildings and amenity spaces ( Brochier et al., 2010 ) . Damage and management costs associated with these impacts can be substantial. For example, in 2006/07, the Western Australian Government spent AU$2.45 million on a surveillance, research and control programme for common starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris ) , which feed on soft fruit and are a threat to agriculture across the region (Roberts, 2006 ) .
Comprehensive knowledge of the characteristics of these impacts is required to inform the prioritisation of management actions to deal with the most damaging alien species (Caffrey et al., 2014 ) . Indeed, at the Fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 15 ) , nations adopted 23 global targets for 2030, including Target 6 which requires the prioritisation of actions towards alien species with the most severe impacts (CBD Secretariat, 2022 ) . Two frameworks and a database have recently been developed which aim to improve understanding of the biodiversity and socio- economic impacts of alien species, by enabling impact data to be categorised, quantified and standardised in a manner that facilitates direct comparisons of impacts by their severity and type. These are the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) (Blackburn et al., 2014 ) , the Socio- economic Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (SEICAT) ( Bacher et al., 2018) and the InvaCost database (Diagne, Leroy, Gozlan, Vaissière, Assailly, et al., 2020 ) . Under EICAT, the environmental impacts of alien species are categorised by their type using impact mechanisms (e.g. competition with native species and predation of native species) and by their severity using five impact categories (Minimal Concern [MC ] , Minor [MN ] , Moderate [MO ] , Major [ MR] and Massive [MV] ) . Published guidelines (IUCN, 2020) provide a series of semi- quantitative impact scenarios which guide the assessment process. SEICAT uses data on the socio- economic impacts of alien species to assess how these impacts affect the well- being of people. Developed in tandem with EICAT, it adopts the same five impact categories (MC– MV ) . InvaCost is a living, publicly available database that provides a systematic, standardised methodology for the collection and treatment of data on the economic costs of alien species, enabling historical cost data in different currencies to be transformed to current, standardised values (Diagne, Leroy, Gozlan, Vaissière, Nuninger, et al., 2020 ) .
EICAT has been used to undertake assessments of the biodiversity impacts of alien species from a range of taxonomic groups such as Acacia species (Jansen & Kumschick, 2022 ) , rabbits and hares ( Allmert et al., 2022) and birds (Evans et al., 2016 ) . The results of the latter study informed research to identify factors that influence the severity of alien bird impacts (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) and factors that make native birds vulnerable to these impacts (Evans et al., 2021 ) . SEICAT has been used to improve understanding of the ways in which alien species from a range of taxonomic groups affect human well- being, including for example, marine fishes in the Mediterranean (Galanidi et al., 2018 ) , gastropods in South Africa ( Kesner & Kumschick, 2018) and birds globally (Evans et al., 2020 ) . InvaCost has been used to describe and analyse the global economic costs associated with specific groups of alien species such as ants ( Angulo et al., 2022 ) , fish (Haubrock et al., 2022) and birds (Evans et al., n.d. ) , and to demonstrate that inaction to manage the impacts of alien species can result in spiralling costs (Ahmed et al., 2022 ) . It has also been used to describe and analyse costs occurring in specific regions of the world (studies on costs have been published for countries and 8 regions to date) (InvaCost, 2022 ) , and to demonstrate that the global costs associated with alien species are grossly underestimated (Diagne et al., 2021 ) .
Thus, EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost provide useful datasets on alien species impacts. However, they each consider specific types of impact (biodiversity, human well- being and economic cost, respectively ) , so when used individually they do not provide information on the complete range of impacts caused by alien species. Combining data from EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost may provide a . Management interventions that prevent the introduction of both predatory and generalist alien bird species, or that reduce their geographic distribution at early stages of invasions, may have significant biodiversity and economic benefits.

EVANS et al. more comprehensive understanding of these impacts. Indeed, identifying the complete range of biodiversity and socio- economic impacts caused by an alien species may better inform the prioritisation of management actions to mitigate its impacts.
Combining data from EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost may also improve our knowledge of the links between biodiversity impacts and economic costs. Identifying statistical links may enable the prediction of biodiversity impacts or economic costs for species lacking data on either. Furthermore, as biodiversity and human well- being are linked through the provision of ecosystem services ( Díaz et al., 2019 ) , identifying connections between biodiversity and socio- economic impacts may inform a more holistic approach to the management of alien species.
To our knowledge, only a small number of studies have investigated relationships between the biodiversity impacts and socioeconomic impacts of alien birds, and all at a regional scale, either in Europe (Kumschick & Nentwig, 2010; Kumschick et al., 2013, 2015; Shirley & Kark, 2009) or Australia (Evans et al., 2014 ) . All adopted a similar method, undertaking a literature review to identify impacts and using a scoring system (Nentwig et al., 2010) to rank impacts by their severity and their type using a series of impact categories (e.g. environmental, economic and human health ) . None of these studies undertook any formal analysis using standardised data on economic costs. The results of these regional- scale studies indicate that some alien bird species are associated with both biodiversity impacts and socio- economic impacts. Indeed, alien bird species in Europe with damaging socio- economic impacts were found to also have damaging biodiversity impacts, although some alien bird species with minor socio- economic impacts also tended to have damaging biodiversity impacts (Kumschick et al., 2015 ) .
Three of these studies identified traits associated with alien birds that may influence the severity of their biodiversity and socioeconomic impacts (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013; Shirley & Kark, 2009 ) , and a further study analysed and identified traits associated with more severe biodiversity impacts (at the global scale) but did not undertake analysis on socio- economic impacts (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) (see Table 1 for a summary of these studies ) . At the regional scale (Europe and Australia ) , traits associated with generalism; e.g. the number of different habitats a species occupies (habitat breadth) or the number of different dietary items a species consumes (diet breadth) are consistently correlated with both more severe biodiversity impacts and socio- economic impacts, whilst traits associated with resource use (e.g. body mass and flockforming species) are less conclusive (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013; Shirley & Kark, 2009 ) . They also indicate that the influence of some traits has been tested for biodiversity impacts (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) but not for socio- economic impacts, including for example, several traits associated with the distribution of alien birds, such as alien range size (Table 1 ) .
Here, we aim to use EICAT, SEICAT and InvaCost data to identify specific types of impacts and factors associated with alien birds that link their biodiversity impacts with their economic costs at the global scale. Based on the results of past studies, we expect to find that the more severe the biodiversity impact caused by an alien bird species, the greater its economic costs will be (hypothesis 1 ) . Because some impact mechanisms (particularly predation) are associated with severe biodiversity impacts (Evans, 2021; Evans et al., 2016 ) , we expect to find that these impact mechanisms are also associated with higher economic costs (hypothesis 2 ) . Finally, also based on the results of past studies, we expect to find TA B LE 1 Results of published studies that have examined the influence of variables on the severity of the biodiversity impacts and socioeconomic impacts of alien birds.

EVANS et al. that specific factors such as species traits (e.g. body mass) are associated with both severe biodiversity impacts and high economic costs (hypothesis 3 ) . | MATERIALS AND METHODS .1 | Data on biodiversity impacts
Data on biodiversity impacts were taken from published global EICAT assessments (Evans et al., 2016) and additional unpublished assessments completed in 2021, which were undertaken in accordance with the EICAT guidelines (IUCN, 2020 ) . From these EICAT assessments, we took each alien bird species' most severe impact score (MC– MV) and the mechanism associated with this impact ( competition, predation, hybridisation etc. ) . For some of these species, no impact data were available to assess their impacts (i.e. no data describing their impacts were found during online literature reviews completed for the EICAT assessments ) . These species were categorised as being ‘data deficient’ (DD) under EICAT. In total, our dataset included 121 alien bird species with an EICAT score ( MC– MV) and 296 species that were DD (417 species in total) (see Table S1, Supporting Information ) . We excluded the feral pigeon ( Columba livia) from our analysis as the true alien range of this species is unknown. See Figure S1 for a flowchart of the methods. .2 | Data on economic costs
The total costs caused by each alien bird species were calculated by summing each available economic cost record for an alien bird species from the InvaCost database (v4.1 ) . These records include costs associated with damage (e.g. to agriculture) and management (e.g. the eradication of an alien bird population due to its damaging biodiversity impacts ) . All costs have been converted in the database to US$ (2017 value ) . For complete information on InvaCost methodology and calculation methods, see Leroy et al. (2022 ) . There are many ‘costs’ associated with both the biodiversity and socio- economic impacts of alien species that are difficult to monetise (e.g. the extinction of a native bird species caused by a predatory alien bird species on an island, which results in a direct decline in biodiversity and may affect local communities by causing negative perceptions of their surrounding environment ) . Thus, our analysis is of monetary costs ( and hereafter, costs are referred to as ‘monetary costs’ ) .
We then reviewed a global alien bird SEICAT assessment (Evans et al., 2020) to gather any additional information on monetary costs caused by alien birds that were not in the InvaCost database. SEICAT assessments incorporate a literature review for each alien species to identify data describing its socio- economic impacts, including cost data (where available ) . Thus, we did not use the actual published SEICAT impact scores (MC– MV) for each alien bird species but rather reviewed the literature gathered on socio- economic impacts during the SEICAT assessments to identify any data on costs.
The monetary costs of alien bird species with weak socioeconomic impacts may not have been calculated or reported because they are likely to be low (and therefore perceived not to be an issue of concern ) . Indeed, invasion biology research tends to focus on species with the most severe impacts (Pyšek et al., 2008 ) . Therefore, to identify alien bird species with low monetary costs, where an alien bird SEICAT assessment identified literature indicating that the monetary costs of an alien bird species were likely to be negligible, we assigned a value of US$0 to these species as a proxy for their actual monetary costs. For example, the little owl (Athene noctua) has been introduced to New Zealand with the aim of controlling other introduced bird species, where it appears to have few negative socio- economic impacts (and associated costs) (New Zealand Birds Online, 2013 ) ; this species was assigned a US$0 cost value (see Table S2, Supporting Information, for species allocated a US$0 cost value ) . We treated all alien bird species that were categorised as DD under SEICAT (i.e. species for which no data on socio- economic impacts were identified during SEICAT assessments) as being DD under InvaCost (i.e. species for which no data on monetary costs were available ) . In total, our dataset included 40 species with cost data (either an actual cost (22 species) or a $0 cost value (18 species ) ) and 378 species that were DD for costs (total = 417 species; the same 417 species assessed under EICAT) (see Table S1, Figure S1, Supporting Information ) .
Our cost calculations included costs associated with the control or eradication of alien bird species, even if these actions were undertaken to manage biodiversity impacts. We recognise that there is a direct link between biodiversity impact and monetary cost in these cases. Nevertheless, some alien bird species may have negligible biodiversity impacts that do not warrant control or eradication. Further, some alien species may be easier (and less costly) to control than others (e.g. flightless alien bird species such as the weka, or bird species with small alien populations ) . Therefore, control and eradication costs are likely to vary depending on the characteristics of the targeted alien bird species and the severity of its biodiversity impacts.
Several of the 22 species with costs had either damage or management costs, but not both. This meant that the dataset of species was too small to undertake separate analysis of damage costs and management costs. We therefore combined damage and management costs for each species for the analysis.
Given the small number of alien bird species in our dataset, we acknowledge that the cost data we identified is unlikely to capture the complete range of monetary costs caused by alien birds. Indeed, our dataset is opportunistic, as the economic costs of alien species are not systematically studied, and therefore InvaCost only captures information on the costs of species that happen to be studied. Thus, our dataset represents a lower bound of costs associated with alien birds. .3 | Data on factors that may drive biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
We identified five broad hypotheses regarding the ways in which alien birds may cause biodiversity impacts and monetary costs , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Portail BibCNRS INEE, Wiley Online Library on [27/11/2023 ] .

EVANS et al. ( H1– H5; Table 2 ) . We collected data on a series of predictor variables associated with each of these hypotheses that are linked to specific factors associated with alien bird species (Table 2 ) . See Data Sources for the sources of data for predictor variables. See Table S3, Supporting Information, for variable descriptions. .4 | Analysis— Linking severe biodiversity impacts with monetary costs; linking types of biodiversity impact with monetary costs
Our analysis of links between biodiversity impacts and monetary costs was restricted to species for which we had both an EICAT score and a cost value (40 species ) . Species categorised as DD under EICAT and/or InvaCost were excluded. Due to small sample sizes for certain EICAT impact categories (MR impacts, n = 3; MV impacts, n = 1 ) , we converted EICAT data into a two- level variable: ‘less severe’ impacts (MC and MN impacts ) , n = 23 species, and ‘more severe’ impacts (MO, MR and MV impacts ) , n = 17 species. This divided impact severity such that ‘less severe’ impacts were those considered to be negligible (MC) or to affect the fitness of individuals of a native species (MN impacts ) , and ‘more severe’ impacts were those considered to be ‘harmful’ under EICAT because they cause declining populations of native species (MO impacts) and local or global species extinctions (MR and MV impacts, respectively ) . Costs were analysed as a continuous variable (US$ ) .
As our dataset considers traits known to be influenced by phylogeny (e.g. body mass) and specific orders and families of alien birds are associated with specific types of impact (e.g. Anatidae with hybridisation ) , we expected our analysis to be influenced by phylogenetic autocorrelation. Following Evans et al. (2021 ) , we used Birdt ree.org (http://birdt ree.org/) to download 100 randomly selected phylogenetic trees incorporating the 40 species in our dataset. We used phylo.d (Fritz & Purvis, 2010) in the Caper package in R (Orme et al., 2018) to calculate the D statistic (a measure of phylogenetic signal in a dataset) for each phylogenetic tree. We identified phylogenetic signal in severity of impact (average D = 0.4) with a low probability of D resulting from no phylogenetic structure (average p = 0.03) or Brownian phylogenetic structure ( average p = 0.2 ) . To address this, we analysed our dataset using phylogenetic linear regression (regression analysis incorporating phylogenetic methods) (Revell, 2010) (the phylolm package in R) ( Tung Ho & Ané, 2014) to account for potential phylogenetic relatedness among species.
TA B LE 2 Proposed hypotheses and their associated factors and variables.
Hypothesis
Factor
Predictor variable
H1: Resource use. Alien species with greater per capita resource requirements place greater demands on the environment, which may affect native biodiversity (e.g. overgrazing of native vegetation) or socio- economic interests (e.g. consumption of agricultural crops)
Size
V1: Body mass
Whether alien bird species are solitary or flock- forming
V2: Sociality
H2: Generalism. Alien species with broad niches will have greater opportunity to cause impacts. For example, those occupying a wide range of habitats are likely to interact with a more diverse range of native species and assets of value to humans, increasing the chances that some of their impacts will be damaging to biodiversity or the economy. Habitat generalist alien birds have been found to have more severe impacts in Europe (Shirley & Kark, 2009) and Australia (Evans et al., 2014 ) , and diet generalist alien birds have more severe impacts in Europe (Evans et al., 2014)
Habitat generalism
V3: Habitat breadth
Diet generalism
V4: Diet breadth
The size of an alien bird species native range (as an indicator of the breadth of environmental conditions a species may tolerate)
V5: Native range size
H3: Dietary preference. Specific diets of alien bird species are associated with specific types of impacts. For example, predatory alien birds ( that eat animal matter) have been deliberately introduced to islands to control pest species (e.g. rats and insects) where they tend to have few reported economic impacts (perhaps because there are fewer opportunities for such impacts on islands) (Evans et al., 2020 ) . However, they have reported biodiversity impacts on these islands ( e.g. by preying on native birds) (Evans, 2021 ) . Frugivorous alien birds may damage soft fruit, whilst seed- eating alien birds may damage crops ( economic impacts ) , and both fruit and seed- eating alien birds may spread the seeds of alien plants (a biodiversity impact)
Diet preference (animal matter)
V6: The proportion of a species' diet comprising animal matter
Diet preference (seeds and fruit)
V7: The proportion of a species' diet comprising seeds and fruit
H4: Distribution. Alien species that have more time to establish and spread may have more damaging impacts; those that are more widespread may have more damaging impacts, because they are likely to be more abundant and because they may have greater opportunity to cause impacts across the different types of habitats that they occupy
The length of time a species has been present as an alien
V8: Alien residence time
The size of a species alien range
V9: Alien range size
H5: Ecological flexibility. Alien species that are better able to adapt to their new environment are more likely to thrive and cause impacts

EVANS et al.
We first compared the association between the severity of biodiversity impacts and monetary costs (phylogenetic linear regression using the phylolm package [and the phylolm function ] ) (Tung Ho & Ané, 2014 ) , with biodiversity impact as a two- level predictor variable as previously described (‘less severe’ impacts and ‘more severe’ impacts ) , and costs as a continuous response variable ) . We then compared the association between different types of biodiversity impacts (using EICAT impact mechanism categories, e.g. competition, predation) and monetary costs. We divided each EICAT impact mechanism into a two- level predictor variable (e.g. competition impact = ‘1’, no competition impact = ‘0’ ) . Competition and predation impacts were analysed separately (competition impact, n = 13 species, no competition impact, n = 27 species; predation impact, n = 15 species, no predation impact, n = 25 species ) . Due to small sample sizes, impacts caused by other mechanisms (hybridisation, grazing, disease transmission, parasitism and structural impacts) were pooled to form a single group titled ‘Other impact mechanisms’ (impact, n = 17 species, no impact, n = 23 species ) . Costs were again analysed as a continuous response variable. We included all impacts caused by a species (not only a species' most severe impacts) when identifying the types of impacts they have. Where a species' impacts were associated with more than one impact mechanism, they were analysed for each of these mechanisms. .5 | Analysis— Identifying drivers of biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
We used the same 100 randomly selected phylogenetic trees, and phylogenetic linear regression (the phylolm function) (Tung Ho & Ané, 2014 ) . We analysed each of the 10 predictor variables against (1) severity of biodiversity impact (a two- level response variable— ‘less severe’ impacts and ‘more severe’ impacts using the phyloglm function ) , and (2) monetary cost (a continuous response variable using the phylolm function ) . The biodiversity impact analysis was similar in approach to that published by Evans, Kumschick, et al. (2018) (the results of this study are summarised in Table 1) but with a different set of alien bird species and a modified set of predictor variables. Undertaking the biodiversity impact analysis in this study, instead of using the results published in Evans, Kumschick, et al. (2018 ) , enabled direct comparisons with the monetary cost analysis undertaken in this study.
We analysed each response variable separately (univariate analysis) and then all variables together, to identify variables with the strongest influence on biodiversity impact and monetary cost (multivariate analysis ) . We checked for multi- collinearity among variables using the car package (Fox & Weisberg, 2019 ) , finding slight evidence for this (highest VIF value = 3.8; Table S4, Supporting Information ) . To address this, we removed two variables that were not found to be significant in univariate analysis (V2: Sociality and V10: Relative brain size ) . This reduced VIF values (all >3; Table S4, Supporting Information ) . During multivariate analysis, for the analysis of monetary costs (using the phylolm function ) , we used the dredge function in the MuMIn package (Bartoń, 2020) to undertake automated model simplification to identify the best- reduced model as ranked by AIC. For the analysis of biodiversity impacts (using the phyloglm function ) , we were unable to use the dredge function. So we reduced the model manually; after each run of the model, we removed the least significant variable, repeating this process to find the best model (as measured by AIC ) . This approach to model simplification follows that adopted for a related study which identified factors which influence the severity of the biodiversity impacts of alien birds (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018 ) . Data for monetary cost, native and alien range size, alien residence time, body mass, brain size, diet preference (animal matter) and diet preference (seeds and fruit) were log- transformed. Plots to show the distribution of the raw data (including log transformations) are provided at Appendix A, Supporting Information. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.1.2) (R Core Team, 2021 ) . | RESULTS
The global distribution of the most severe biodiversity impacts and monetary costs of the 40 alien bird species in our dataset is shown in Figure 1. A summary of these impacts and costs for each alien bird species is provided in Table S2, Supporting Information. .1 | Linking severe biodiversity impacts with monetary costs; linking types of biodiversity impact with monetary costs
We did not find a consistent association between severity of biodiversity impact and monetary cost, although relationships were identified for some of the 100 phylogenies analysed (Table 3 ) . Alien bird species with reported predation impacts tended to have higher monetary costs (Table 3, Figure 2 ) . No associations between other types of biodiversity impact (competition and ‘other impact mechanisms’) and monetary costs were identified (Table 3 ) . Residual plots and model output summaries are provided in Appendix A, Supporting Information. .2 | Drivers of biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
In univariate analysis, positive relationships were identified for variables associated with generalism (hypothesis H2 ) . Habitat generalist alien bird species had both more severe biodiversity impacts and higher monetary costs, while diet generalist alien bird species had more severe biodiversity impacts (and higher monetary costs for some of the phylogenies tested, though this effect was not significant on average) (Table 4 ) . These were the only variables linked to both more severe biodiversity impacts and high monetary costs. Positive relationships were also identified , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Portail BibCNRS INEE, Wiley Online Library on [27/11/2023 ] .

EVANS et al. for variables associated with distribution (hypotheses H4 ) . Alien bird species with larger alien ranges had higher monetary costs, and those that have been present for longer also had higher monetary costs (though not for all 100 phylogenies tested) (Table 4 ) . No relationships were identified for any variables associated with other hypotheses; resource use, dietary preference and ecological flexibility (hypotheses H1, H3 and H5, respectively) (Table 4 ) . For variables with significant relationships, the distribution of species by the severity of their biodiversity impacts and their monetary costs is shown in Figure 3.
Analysing all variables together, alien bird species with more severe biodiversity impacts tended to be diet generalists, whilst alien birds with higher monetary costs tended to have larger alien ranges ( Table 5 ) . The univariate relationship between habitat breadth and more severe biodiversity impacts was not recovered; nor were the univariate relationships between habitat and diet breadth and higher monetary costs, and alien residence time and higher monetary costs. .3 | Data deficiency
Most alien bird species in our dataset were data deficient for both biodiversity impacts and monetary costs (n = 296, 71% of all species) ( Table S1, Supporting Information ) . Some species with reported biodiversity impacts were data deficient for monetary costs (n = 81, 19% of all species ) . No species that were data deficient for biodiversity impacts had data describing their monetary costs (Table S1, Supporting Information ) . | DISCUSSION .1 | Linking severity and type of biodiversity impact with high monetary costs

EVANS et al. et al., 2010) in Taiwan, but this hybridisation appears to have no tangible costs. Our assessment does not, therefore, capture certain ‘costs’ caused by alien birds. Indeed, monetary costs only tend to be reported when biodiversity impacts are considered severe enough to warrant management. However, the biodiversity impacts of alien birds in general tend to be relatively minor and often go unmanaged ( Evans et al., 2016 ) . This may be why we did not identify a link between the severity of the biodiversity impacts caused by alien birds and high monetary costs. Indeed, the highest costs caused by alien birds tend to be associated with damage to assets of value (such as buildings and agricultural crops) rather than their biodiversity impacts (Evans et al., n.d. ) .
However, we did find predatory alien birds to be associated with monetary costs. The cost calculations for our analysis are of combined management and damage costs, and not all costs associated with predatory alien bird species arise due to the management of their predation impacts; some are the result of the damage they cause to assets of value (e.g. agriculture ) . Predatory alien birds may therefore be associated with costs in part because they tend to possess characteristics that provide them with greater opportunity to cause impacts (and not only through predation of native species ) . Indeed, the alien bird species in our dataset with reported predation impacts tend to be diet and habitat generalists (average diet and habitat breadth score = 4 and 5, respectively) when compared to species that do not have reported predation impacts (2.7 and 3.2, respectively ) ; they also tend to have larger alien ranges (average = 3,690,419 km2 vs. 165,077 km2 ) . Nevertheless, predation by alien birds can be damaging to native species (Evans, 2021; Evans et al., 2016 ) , and due to the severity of these impacts, predatory alien birds may be targeted for management and thus be associated with monetary costs. For example, species in our dataset that have been managed due to their predation impacts include the African sacred ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus ) , common myna (Acridotheres tristis ) , house crow (Corvus splendens) and weka (Gallirallus australis ) . Indeed, invasion biology research tends to focus on alien species with severe biodiversity impacts (Pyšek et al., 2008 ) , and there may therefore be more studies to identify predation impacts in comparison to other impact mechanisms, and hence more schemes to FI G U R E 2 The total monetary costs caused by alien bird species as distributed by whether they do or do not have reported predation impacts. y- axis = the total monetary cost (logged) of an alien bird species (US$ ) .

EVANS et al. manage predation impacts. Several other species in our dataset have attracted research to assess the effect of their predation impacts; e.g. the common starling (Fisher & Wiebe, 2006) and the little owl ( Athene noctua) (Hayden, 2004 ) .
However, because some alien bird species prey on other species to survive, predation impacts are likely to occur more frequently than impacts associated with some other mechanisms, such as hybridisation and transmission of diseases, and thus there may be more management schemes (with costs) to control and eradicate them. Furthermore, predation impacts may be easier to identify than impacts caused through other mechanisms, such as competition, hybridisation and the transmission of diseases (Evans et al., 2021; FI G U R E 3 ( a) The severity of the biodiversity impacts caused by alien bird species as distributed by their: (i) habitat breadth and (ii) diet breadth.

Tompkins & Jakob- Hoff, 2011 ) , and some predatory alien birds are relatively large species (though not always, see Figure 2) that prey on smaller bird species (Evans, 2021 ) , and their size may make them easier to identify and control. Thus, due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence of predation impacts, and the relative ease of the identification of predation impacts and management of (some) predatory alien birds, they are more likely to be associated with monetary costs than other impact mechanisms. Interventions to stop the introduction of predatory alien birds may prevent frequent ( and potentially severe) biodiversity impacts and unwanted monetary costs associated with schemes to manage them. .2 | Identifying factors associated with biodiversity impacts and monetary costs
Our results suggest that certain factors afford alien birds greater opportunity to cause deleterious effects, whether they be on biodiversity or the economy, or both. Habitat and diet generalists are more likely to have impacts than specialist species restricted to a limited range of environments and food types. This may be because they have greater opportunity to cause impacts, as they are likely to interact with a broader range of native species and to come into contact with a wider range of assets of value to humans. Indeed, the species in our dataset with broad environmental tolerances also tend to be able to occupy urban environments, where they may cause biodiversity impacts in parks and gardens and affect assets of value such as buildings. All but one of the eight species with the greatest habitat breadth in our dataset (occupying six or more broad habitat types) have severe biodiversity impacts and monetary costs >$0.
Variables associated with the geographic distribution of alien species (alien residence time, and in particular, alien range size) were also predictors of monetary costs. This is likely to be because widespread species have a greater opportunity to cause deleterious effects on both biodiversity and the economy and in different ways at different locations (see Figure 1 ) . For example, the common myna has one of the largest alien ranges in our dataset ( > 2,300,000 km2; the median for all species in our dataset = 114,864 km2 ) . It has reported monetary costs on French Polynesia and Seychelles (Evans et al., n.d.) and reported competition impacts in Australia (Grarock et al., 2012) and predation impacts in Israel, and on Seychelles, Cook Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Hawaii, Mauritius and Midway Atoll (it is known to prey on at least 16 native bird species from five orders) (Evans, 2021 ) . Alien bird species present for longer time periods have had more time to establish and spread. For example, the African sacred ibis was introduced to France in the 1970s, and its population spread along the Atlantic Coast over several decades before the implementation of a costly eradication programme to address its unwanted impacts, which included predation of native birds (Yésou et al., 2017 ) .
Because generalist and widespread alien bird species have a greater opportunity to cause deleterious effects (on either biodiversity or the economy ) , they are also more likely to be subject to control or eradication measures, which can be costly. Indeed, over half of the 10 species in our dataset with the greatest habitat breadth and longest alien residence times have reported costs associated with their management. These costs are likely to increase as the distributional extent of an alien species' increases and it becomes more difficult to control or eradicate. The unsuccessful eradication of approximately 1 million house crows in Zanzibar (Tanzania ) , undertaken to address deleterious effects on both biodiversity and the economy ( ZABISO, 2020 ) , has so far cost approximately US$1.5 million (van Ham et al., 2013 ) ; the successful eradication of a small population of house crows ( < 30) on Socotra Island (Yemen) cost US$20,500 ( Suleiman & Taleb, 2010 ) .
Our results suggest that timely management interventions, sensu ( Hulme et al., 2009 ) , to limit the distributional extent of alien bird species (particularly generalist species and those that prey on native species) may have important benefits for both biodiversity and the economy. It may be too late to efficiently address the impacts of some widespread, generalist, predatory alien bird species such as the ring- necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) in the UK, as these efforts are now likely to be costly (Ahmed et al., 2022 ) . However, there may be opportunities to do so for recent alien bird incursions, and for those occurring in the future (alien species' numbers are predicted to rise considerably by 2050, including numbers of alien bird species) (Seebens et al., 2021 ) . In the UK, for example, climate change may be assisting the establishment of the red- billed leiothrix ( Leiothrix lutea) (Broughton et al., 2022 ) .
We identified a negative (though non- significant) trend between relative brain size and both severity of biodiversity impact and monetary cost. This is likely due to the presence of several parrot species in our dataset, which are large- brained and tend to have minor biodiversity impacts and low (or no) reported monetary costs. That said, two parrot species in our dataset do have high reported monetary costs (the ring- necked parakeet and the monk parakeet [Myiopsitta monachus] ) , and the ring- necked parakeet also has ‘more severe’ biodiversity impacts; e.g. by preying on native bat species in Spain (Hernández- Brito et al., 2018 ) . Notably, these are the two parrot species in our dataset with the largest alien ranges, longest alien residence times and greatest habitat breadth scores (all variables associated with severe biodiversity impacts and/or monetary costs ) . .3 | Comparing our results to past studies
Although our dataset is relatively small (40 species; approximately onethird of the 116 species identified as having environmental impacts worldwide) (Evans et al., 2016 ) , the biodiversity impacts and monetary costs in our dataset are broadly distributed across the globe. In another global study (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018 ) , factors associated with the distributional extent of alien birds (alien range size and alien residence time) were found to be predictors of more severe biodiversity impacts. Our study is the first to test the influence of these factors on the socio- economic impacts (monetary costs) of alien birds, and we , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Portail BibCNRS INEE, Wiley Online Library on [27/11/2023 ] .

EVANS et al. confirm that distributional extent not only drives more severe biodiversity impacts but also high monetary costs. Our results for generalism support the findings of previous studies, which have found habitat and diet breadth to be predictors of more severe biodiversity impacts at the global scale (Evans, Kumschick, et al., 2018) and habitat breadth to be a predictor of more severe biodiversity and socio- economic impacts at the regional scale (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013; Shirley & Kark, 2009 ) . However, our study was the first to use cost data, and it demonstrates that generalism is specifically linked with higher costs (as opposed to broadly defined socio- economic impacts ) . Indeed, using data on costs, our study is the first to try to link the severity and type of biodiversity impacts caused by alien birds with their monetary costs. In so doing, our study demonstrates that predation impacts are more likely to be associated with monetary costs when compared to other mechanisms.
Two regional studies found body mass to be associated with more severe biodiversity impacts and socio- economic impacts in Europe (Evans et al., 2014; Kumschick et al., 2013 ) , but we did not identify any significant relationships with body mass at the global scale. For biodiversity impacts, this may be because analysis undertaken in the two regional studies did not include data on island impacts (as many islands occupied by alien birds are located outside of Europe ) . Biodiversity impacts caused by alien birds tend to be particularly severe on islands (Evans, 2021; Evans et al., 2021 ) , and some of these impacts (in our dataset) are caused by relatively small alien bird species such as the red- vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer ) . With regard to monetary costs, there are several relatively small alien bird species in our dataset that have costs by causing agricultural damage in low- income regions, such as the village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus) in the Dominican Republic; there are many low- income regions outside of Europe. The contrasting results of these regional studies and our global study suggest that alien bird risk assessments should account for scale. For example, our results may not be as relevant to biodiversity risk assessments for alien bird incursions within mainland Europe, where no islands are present. .4 | Data deficiency and impact prediction
Most alien bird species in our dataset do not have reported biodiversity impacts or monetary costs. It has been concluded that alien bird species with no reported biodiversity impacts that have large alien ranges and/or long alien residence times are likely to have minor biodiversity impacts because if these impacts were severe, they would have been noticed and reported (Evans, Pigot, et al., 2018 ) . On this basis, we suggest that alien bird species with these traits that have no reported monetary costs are genuinely likely to have low monetary costs (those that can be monetised ) . However, as the impacts of alien species tend to be context dependent (Pyšek et al., 2020 ) , and human development influences the availability of impact data across different regions of the world (Evans & Blackburn, 2020 ) , we cannot rule out that some alien bird species with no reported costs do actually have monetary costs particularly in less developed regions. Indeed, the economic impacts of alien species are often felt most acutely by the rural poor, where they affect agricultural activities and food security (Perrings, 2005 ) , but alien species tend to be less studied in these regions (Bellard & Jeschke, 2015 ) .
Many species (n = 81) with reported biodiversity impacts are data deficient for monetary costs. Nevertheless, these species tend to have relatively small alien ranges when compared to alien bird species with reported monetary costs (Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . As we found alien range size to be positively correlated with monetary cost, it is possible that some of these species will have low monetary costs. Nevertheless, some of the 81 species that are data deficient for monetary costs have relatively large alien ranges, such as the house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) (see Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . As alien range size is positively correlated with cost, species like this may have monetary costs that ( as far as we are aware) have not been published.
Four predatory alien bird species (raptors) that have been introduced to oceanic islands to control rats and insect pests have severe biodiversity impacts by preying on native species, but they are data deficient for monetary costs; the Australian masked- owl (Tyto novaehollandiae ) , barn owl (Tyto alba ) , great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) and swamp harrier (Circus approximans) (Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . Their predation impacts may be difficult to value, and their opportunity to cause negative socio- economic impacts on islands may be limited, as there may be fewer assets of value to affect, and thus their costs may be low (Vaissière et al., 2022 ) . This may be why two other species with severe biodiversity impacts on islands have a cost value of US$0 (the green junglefowl (Gallus varius) and black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) (Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . This absence of cost data for raptors on islands may appear to counter our result regarding the positive association between predation and monetary costs. However, the Australian masked- owl is to be eradicated from Lord Howe Island (Australia) due to the severity of its biodiversity impacts (O'Dwyer & Carlile, 2016 ) , and barn owls are being managed in Hawaii due to their biodiversity impacts (Bean, 2013; Raine et al., 2019 ) . These management actions will be costly, but as far as we are aware, these costs have not been published. Thus, severe predation impacts on islands may also drive monetary costs. This may also appear to counter our result regarding the positive association between alien range size and monetary cost (as being on islands, these alien raptor species have small alien ranges; Figure S2, Supporting Information ) . However, costs incurred managing alien raptors on islands are likely to be relatively low compared to damage and management costs associated with broadly distributed alien bird species at mainland locations (Evans et al., n.d. ) . | CONCLUSIONS
By combining data on the biodiversity impacts, socio- economic impacts and monetary costs of alien birds, we identify links between their biodiversity impacts and monetary costs. Our results indicate that management interventions to prevent the introduction of both predatory and , 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10521 by Portail BibCNRS INEE, Wiley Online Library on [27/11/2023 ] .

People and Nature
EVANS et al. generalist alien bird species, or that reduce their geographic distribution at early stages of invasions, may have significant biodiversity and economic benefits. We missed the opportunity to efficiently manage some alien bird species which are now widespread and abundant across many regions of the world; we need not miss these opportunities for future alien bird invasions, which are predicted to increase in number in the future (Seebens et al., 2021 ) . Whilst we lack data on the monetary costs associated with many alien bird species, we predict that some of these species are likely to have low monetary costs. Nevertheless, our results lead us to conclude that species with no reported costs but with large alien ranges and/or predation impacts should be further studied as potential candidates for high monetary costs.

Abstract
Passive rewilding is increasingly seen as a promising tool to counterbalance biodiversity losses and recover native forest ecosystems. One key question, crucial to understanding assembly processes and conservation issues underlying land-use change, is the extent to which functional and phylogenetic diversity may recover in spontaneous recent woodlands. Here, we compared understorey plant communities of recent woodlands (which result from afforestation on agricultural lands during the 20th century) with those of ancient forests (uninterrupted for several centuries) in a hotspot of farmland abandonment in western Europe. We combined taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity metrics to detect potential differences in community composition, structure (richness, divergence ) , conservation importance (functional originality and specialisation, evolutionary distinctiveness) and resilience (functional redundancy, response diversity ) . The recent and ancient forests harbored clearly distinct compositions, especially regarding the taxonomic and phylogenetic facets. Recent woodlands had higher taxonomic functional and phylogenetic richness and a higher evolutionary distinctiveness, whereas functional divergence and phylogenetic divergence were higher in ancient forests. On another hand, we did not find any significant differences in functional specialisation, originality, redundancy, or response diversity between recent and ancient forests. Our study constitutes one of the first empirical pieces of evidence that recent woodlands may spontaneously regain plant communities phylogenetically rich and functionally resilient, at least as much as those of ancient relict forests. As passive rewilding is the cheapest restoration method, we suggest that it should be a very useful tool to restore and conserve native forest biodiversity and functions, especially when forest areas are restricted and fragmented. Key words: ancient forest; farmland abandonment; recent woodlands; response diversity; resilience; temporal forest continuity
Introduction
Rewilding is currently emerging as a novel conservation proposal to reduce anthropic forcing and restore the structural and functional complexity of degraded ecosystems (Fernádez et al., 2017; Torres et al., 2018 ) . Considering the growing trend of farmland abandonment in developed countries (up to 16 million hectares by 2020 in Europe; Keenleyside et al., 2010 ) , vast areas are being de-domesticated and offer a historical opportunity to rewild human-dominated landscapes. The debate on the interests of these emerging conservationist approaches is currently Accepted Article very lively, underscoring the need for further studies to rule on the ecological consequences, beneficial or not, of rewilding (Nogués-Bravo et al., 2016; Perino et al., 2019; Derham, 2019; Hayward et al., 2019; Pettorelli et al., 2019 ) . In this perspective, passive rewilding - the spontaneous restoration of woodlands - is increasingly seen as a promising tool to restore nativeforest biodiversity and ecosystem services (Proença et al., 2012; Pereira and Navarro, 2015 ) . A crucial socio-ecological issue is to determine the extent to which passive rewilding may allow for the restoration of rich forest biodiversity and ecosystem functions, at least like those of ancient relict forests that have become very rare (Cramer et al., 2008; Queiroz et al., 2014; Pereira and Navarro, 2015 ) . These last decades, considerable efforts have been made to pinpoint the ecological differences between plant communities of spontaneous recent woodlands (i.e. post-agricultural woodlands emerging spontaneously through a secondary succession process during the 20th century) and those of ancient forests (i.e. forests uninterrupted for at least the last 150-400 years, sensu Hermy et al., 1999 ) . Most of these investigations provided evidence that temporal forest continuity (i.e. the duration of an uninterrupted forest state) strongly influenced the taxonomic composition of forest plant communities, as well as the composition of life-history traits ( Hofmeister et al., 2019 ) . The interruption of temporal continuity indeed limits the recruitment and the dispersal of forest species, so that recent woodlands are often quite different from ancient forests (see Hermy and Verheyen, 2007 for a review ) . In particular, recent woodlands are distinguished from ancient forests by the lack, or the low frequency, of typical specialist forest species, mainly characterized by low dispersal capacities (large seeds, low fecundity, unassisted dispersal, Verheyen et al., 2003; Kimberley et al., 2013 ) . As a consequence, recent woodlands resulting from farmland abandonment are often perceived negatively, especially in Europe since they are established on agroecosystems that benefit from a great socio-cultural value (Schnitzler, ; Queiroz et al., 2014 ) . The key question of the way functional diversity responds to passive rewilding still remains unanswered. Functional diversity is one of the most crucial informations to be explored so as to determine whether and how communities functionally support distinct and more or less diverse species that in turn provide different ecosystem properties and services (Cadotte et al., 2011; Mouillot et al., 2013 ) . Functional diversity also sheds light on assembly processes, reflected by the structure of the niches occupied by communities such as their size, complementarity, and their Accepted Article degree of functional specialisation or originality (Pavoine and Bonsall, 2011; Mouillot et al., ). In particular, functional redundancy and response diversity are very relevant metrics for studying the ecological resilience of ecosystems (Mori et al., 2013 ) , that is the ability of an ecosystem to absorb changes caused by disturbances (see Angeler and Allen, 2016 ) . Functional redundancy, which refers to the number of species contributing to an ecosystem function, provides a powerful estimation of the community functional stability by indicating the extent to which ecological functions are ensured by multiple species. Response diversity gives insights into the resilience of communities by measuring how functionally similar species respond differently to disturbances (Elmqvist et al., 2003 ) . Yet, we still ignore whether plant communities of recent woodlands differ functionally from ancient forests, and what the consequences on ecosystem properties and biodiversity conservation could be.
Phylogenetic diversity metrics can provide complementary, useful information to highlight the intrinsic conservation value of sites by focusing on the proportion of evolutionary history conserved within ecological communities (Winter et al., 2013; Frishkoff et al. 2014; Morelli et al., ; Harrison et al., 2018 ) . The study of phylogenetic diversity in recent woodlands is also just beginning and has mainly focused on tropical fauna (e.g. Edwards et al., 2017 ) . Phylogenetic diversity can also be used to understand assembly processes and species coexistence (Prinzing et al., 2016 ) . Moreover, phylogenetic diversity may reflect functional diversity and hence impact ecosystem functions (Crisp and Cook, 2012 ) , so that it can be used as a useful proxy for functional diversity, in particular when traits of interest are very numerous and tedious to measure. Phylogenetic richness basically represents the number of different lineages harbored in a community (Faith, 1992 ) . Evolutionary distinctiveness and phylogenetic divergence illustrate the difference in the evolutionary history of species relatively to other species, and informs on the phylogenetic rarity of species and on diversification processes (Webb, 2002; Isaac et al., 2007 ) . Yet, the way passive rewilding impacts the evolutionary history and conservation importance of forest plant communities remains largely unknown. We used field data collected in one of the main hotspots of farmland abandonment in the EU ( see Renwick et al., 2013 ) , namely the Armorican massif (western France ) , to assess how temporal forest continuity reshapes the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of herbaceous forest plant communities. We investigated the extent to which composition and structure (so called β- and α-diversity) of plant communities may recover in recent woodlands as compared to ancient forests. We tested the differences in community composition, structure, conservation importance, Accepted Article and resilience capabilities, using several indices assessing (i) taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic community composition, (ii) the main components of functional and phylogenetic diversity (richness, divergence ) , (iii) functional and phylogenetic distinctiveness, and (iv) functional redundancy and response diversity. Materials and Methods
Study sites, habitat conditions and floristic surveys
The study was conducted in different forest environments in western France, in the Armorican massif (Appendix S1: Fig. S1 ) . We selected 36 plots of ~ 1 ha of mesophilic, oakbeech dominated, mature forest within the regional biogeographical province (Appendix S1: Table S1 ) , and thereby strongly limited the influence of environmental heterogeneity and stand maturity. We set apart ancient forests from recent woodlands by checking the temporal forest continuity of each forest site by consulting the historical Cassini map layers (year 1790) and the Napoleonic cadastre (year 1847 ) . We defined ancient forests as uninterrupted forests (not to be mistaken with unlogged forests) for at least 230 years, and recent woodlands as forests resulting from afforestation during the 20th century, i.e. no more than 120 years old. Our dataset included 24 plots in ancient forests (from 6 different forest sites) and 12 plots in recent woodlands (from two different forest sites ) . The site areas ranged from 200 ha to 4,000 ha.
Several habitat descriptors as well as Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIV) were used to characterize the habitat structure and the ecological conditions of the selected plots and ensure the environmental homogeneity of the dataset (Appendix S1: Table S2 ) . The vegetation composition of the understorey (below 2 meters and including woody species) was assessed in June-July 2014 and 2015 in each selected plot. The percent cover of each vascular plant species (101 in total) was recorded within 50-m² (10 x 5m) plots. Plots were at least meters away from the nearest forest edge to minimize edge effects.
Selection of functional traits and phylogenetic analyses
We selected a set of nine functional traits from the LEDA database (Kleyer et al., 2008; Appendix S1: Table S3) to obtain a multidimensional representation of plant functional variability related to resource acquisition, competitive capacities, dispersal abilities, and regenerative strategies. Consequently, these traits are simultaneously response and effect traits (Appendix S1: Table S3 ) . We specifically selected (i) two vegetative traits linked to the leaf economic spectrum and associated to competitive abilities, resource use and allocation strategy (SLA, LDMC ) , (ii) Accepted Article four regeneration and dispersal traits (Dispersal syndrome, Pollination, Seed mass, and Start of flowering ) , and (iii) three integrative traits of the plant status considering global life-history strategies (Height, Life span, and Life form ) . For continuous data, all the available trait values were averaged per species. Missing trait values (2.1% of the data) were estimated using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE ) , a procedure that efficiently predicts mean matching from observed life-history trait values (Penone et al., 2014 ) . Prior to analyses, continuous traits were log-transformed to make their distribution more symmetric and to reduce the variance between traits. We tested the correlations between traits to reduce redundant information, but they were lower than 0.6 (Appendix S1: Fig. S2 ) , so we kept the nine traits to perform analyses.
To assess phylogenetic diversity, we used the global supertree of Zanne et al. (2014 ) . Among the 101 species we collected, 99 species (98%) were included in the tree. We added the missing two species in the global tree by creating polytomies at the genus level. Taxonomic diversity
We used species richness as an indicator of taxonomic α-diversity (Magurran, 2004 ) . For further comparisons at the α-level between diversity metrics of recent woodlands and ancient forests, we used linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) to account for potential spatial autocorrelation between plots and for the hierarchical structure of our sampling design. In addition, this procedure also allows accounting the potential influence of initial abiotic conditions ( for which geological substrates is a good proxy) of the selected plots that could interfere with the studied factor (forest category ) . Therefore, we used the forest category (ancient or recent) as a fixed effect and defined the hierarchical structure (sampling plots nested within study sites) as well as geologic substrates (Appendix S1: Table S1) as random effects. Species richness was logtransformed to improve model fitness after a first test with generalized linear mixed effects models ( GLMMs ) . We quantified variation in community species composition (so called taxonomic β-diversity) by measuring the dissimilarities between each pair of plots with Jaccard's index, an usual betadiversity metric weakly influenced by sampling error and thus adapted to restricted dataset such ours (Schroeder and Jenkins, 2018 ) . We performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling ( NMDS) to visualize the overall taxonomic β-diversity. Then, to evaluate whether assemblages of recent woodlands differed from ancient forests, we applied permutational multivariate analysis of Accepted Article variance (PERMANOVA) on the Jaccard dissimilarity matrix. We performed 10,000 permutations, restricted between sites and geological substrates to account for potential spatial autocorrelation between plots and for the hierarchical structure of the dataset (sampling plots nested within sites) as well as initial abiotic conditions. Finally, we assessed whether recent woodlands were more homogeneous between them than ancient forests. For this, we compared levels of within taxonomic β-diversity between the two forest categories by calculating βdispersion, which measures the distance of communities from the centroid of a group in a multivariate space. The significance of the difference in the median distance was evaluated using permutation tests (999 permutations; Anderson et al., 2006 ) .
We quantified functional α-diversity using several indices. First, we used multivariate indices: functional richness (FRic) and functional divergence (FDiv ) , that measure functional dissimilarities of communities within a multidimensional space (Villéger et al., 2008; see Table 1 for details about metrics and their meanings ) . Several traits were categorical, so we performed a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on a Gower dissimilarity matrix computed on species traits. To find the best multidimensional space possible, we used the mean squared deviation ( mSD) criterion, which measured how the initial functional distances (based on trait values) were accurately represented in the final multidimensional PCoA-based space, as recommended by Maire et al. (2015 ) : the lower the mean squared deviation, the higher the quality of the functional space. We kept three dimensions for the functional space (mSD = 0.008 ) . All the functional metrics presented below were then calculated within this functional space. Second, we assessed the conservation importance of plant communities by selecting metrics that focused on the degree of specialisation and distinctiveness of functional traits regarding the overall species pool (i.e. the species of our dataset ) : functional specialisation (FSpe) and functional originality (FOri; see Table 1 ) . Third, we assessed the community stability and resilience of plant communities by calculating the functional redundancy (FR) and the response diversity (RD) of each assemblage ( see Table 1 for details ) . We estimated FR following de Bello et al. (2007) and Ricotta et al. (2016) which proposed a method allowing to account for continuous life-history traits and integrate species abundance and evenness in the calculation. In this framework, FR is defined as the extent to which a community is ‘saturated’ with species harboring similar traits rather simply the number of species noted within Accepted Article discrete functional groups (Ricotta et al., 2016 ) . Here so, FR is measured as the difference between taxonomic diversity (with Simpson’s index) and functional diversity (with Rao’s quadratic entropy ) ; redundancy is at a maximum when functional diversity is weak because all the species are functionally identical and as a minimum if functional diversity equals taxonomic diversity because all the species are functionally different.
To estimate RD, we followed Laliberté et al. (2010) who suggests assessing the variation in responses of functionally similar species to environmental changes (that is response diversity; Elmqvist et al., 2003) by calculating the mean functional dispersion (FDis) within the functional groups of each community. Since this method uses an index independent from species richness ( FDis ) , it allows an assessment of response diversity that is not trivially related to functional redundancy (Laliberté et al. 2010; Mori et al., 2013 ) . So, we first divided the species pool into functional groups to then assess the extent to which the responses of species contributing to similar functions (so within a single functional group) are diversified. This allows to assess whether the species and the functions they provide are potentially resilient to disturbances. Since it is irrational to represent functional relatedness between species using a dendrogram (i.e. assuming hierarchical differences ) , we used the k-means methods to partition functional groups within the previously built functional space. Note that we did not built two separate functional spaces (one for response groups and another for effect groups) such as Laliberté et al. (2010) because all traits we selected represent key characteristics of plant responses to environmental filtering as well as plant effects on ecosystem processes and services (see Appendix S1: Table S3 ) . Thus, from the same functional space, we identified functional groups of species performing similar functions and then we measured the variation in responses of these species to environmental changes. The appropriate number of clusters (i.e. the functional groups) was determined using the Gap statistic ( Tibshirani et al., 2001 ) . This process, which avoids a subjective delimitation of groups, yielded nine functional group (Appendix S1: Figs S3-S4 ) . Then, we calculated the mean functional dispersion (FDis) within the nine functional groups and within each community to assess response diversity of the sampled assemblages (Laliberté et al., 2010 ) . For example, a community recording a high response diversity indicates that the species noted within the different functional groups present, will have various responses to ecological disturbances, which is a key parameter for the ecosystem resilience. The comparisons of functional α-diversities between recent woodlands and ancient forests followed the same methods as the comparisons of taxonomic α-diversity (i.e.
LMMs, see above ) .

We quantified functional β-diversity between communities from the two forest categories using the same methods as taxonomic β-diversity (NMDS, PERMANOVA and β-dispersion, see above ) . However, analyses ran on a dissimilarity matrix based on a Jaccard's derived index focusing on functional traits of species (Villéger et al., 2013 ) .
Phylogenetic diversity
We quantified phylogenetic α-diversity using indices recommended by Tucker et al. (2016 ) : phylogenetic diversity (PD) for richness and mean pairwise distance (MPD) for divergence (see Table 1 for metrics details ) . We also evaluated the conservation importance by measuring the evolutionary distinctiveness of each community, i.e. the amount of unique evolutionary history supported by the assemblage (see Table 1 for details ) . Comparisons of phylogenetic α-diversities between recent woodlands and ancient forests followed the same methods as comparisons of taxonomic and functional α-diversities (i.e. LMMs, see above ) .
We quantified phylogenetic β-diversity between communities from the two forest categories using the same methods as for quantifying taxonomic and functional β-diversity (NMDS, PERMANOVA and β-dispersion, see above ) . However, analyses ran on a dissimilarity matrix based on a Jaccard's derived index focusing on the position of species along the phylogenetic tree ( Leprieur et al., 2012 ) .
Comparison between α-diversity indices and null models
We compared functional and phylogenetic indices calculated for α-diversity to null models to test whether functional and phylogenetic structures differed from random expectations. Used together, the richness and divergence indices provide good power to discriminate assembly processes (Mason et al., 2013 ) . Specifically, random communities (n=999) were generated by shuffling species labels across the functional matrix or the phylogenetic dendrogram pool. This approach maintained the species richness of each community but made the identities of those species random as regards the whole pool. The standardized effect sizes (SES) were used to measure the difference between observed values and null expectations: SES = (FDobs – mean ( FDnull ) ) /SDnull ) . Positive SES values indicated functional or phylogenetic overdispersion, whereas negative values indicated clustering. Null values (i.e. showing no difference with null distribution) indicated random patterns of assembly. We used Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test to test the statistical significance of average functional and phylogenetic α-diversity as compared to the null model. Accepted Article
All analyses were performed using R version 3.3.3 (R Core Team 2016 ) . Prior treatments of the species-by-trait matrix and the phylogenetic dendrogram were computed using the packages ‘labsdv’, ‘mice’, ‘picante’ and the ‘quality_funct_space’ function (Maire et al., 2015 ) ; indices were calculated with the packages ‘adiv’, ‘betapart’, ‘vegan’ and the ‘multidimFD’ function ( Maire et al., 2015 ) ; statistical tests were assessed using the ‘Lme4’ and ‘permute’ packages.
Results
Environmental conditions of selected plots
The variables describing habitat structure (canopy cover, basal area and diameter at breast height of the five largest trees (Oaks ) ) highlighted no difference between recent and ancient forests. Similarly, EIV indicated no significant difference in moisture degrees and light availability between the two forest categories. On the other hand, EIV showed that soils under recent woodlands had significantly higher pH values and nutrient concentrations than those under ancient forests (Appendix S1: Table S2 ) .
Taxonomic diversity
A total of 101 plants species were collected across the 36 sampling plots. Among them, 38 species were found in the two forests categories, 31 were only found in recent woodlands ( Appendix S1: Fig. S5) and 32 only in ancient forests. On average, species richness of communities was dramatically higher in recent woodlands than in ancient forests (24.1 ± 8 vs. 15.6 ± 6.6 [mean ± sd ] ; p < 0.05, Wald’s test; Fig. 1a ) .
NMDS showed strong separation of species composition between the plant communities of recent and ancient forests (Fig. 3 ) . The PERMANOVA additionally showed significant differences in the taxonomic composition of plant communities between the two forest categories (p = 0.001 ) . β-dispersion – a measure of within β-diversity – did not differ between recent woodlands and ancient forests (permutation-based test; p = 0.083 ) .
Accepted Article
Functional richness was higher in recent woodlands, whereas functional divergence displayed an opposite pattern (Wald’s test, p 0.05; Fig. 2a ) . Moreover, functional redundancy and response diversity did not differ between recent woodlands and ancient forests (Wald’s test; p > 0.05; Fig. 2b ) . The standardized effect size of functional richness (SES.FRic) did not differ from the random expectations for recent woodlands, but was significantly lower than the null distribution for ancient forests (Fig. 1b ) . The standardized effect size of functional divergence (SES.FDiv) significantly differed from random expectations for both forest categories, which exhibited clustered patterns, with a larger departure from null distribution for recent woodlands (Wilcoxon’s rank test; p > 0.05; Fig. 1b ) . NMDS showed a slight separation of functional composition between the two forest categories: within the ordination space, the functional composition of recent woodlands appeared as a subpart of the functional composition of ancient forests (Fig. 3 ) . PERMANOVA confirmed that these differences were significant (p = 0.003 ) , as well as β-dispersion. Therefore, functional dissimilarities in recent woodlands were significantly lower than in ancient forests (permutationbased test; p = 0.017 ) .
Phylogenetic diversity
Phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary distinctiveness were much higher in recent woodlands (Wald’s test; p < 0.05; Fig. 1a, Fig. 2 ) . Only phylogenetic divergence (i.e. the mean pairwise distance) was slightly higher in ancient forests. The standardized size effects for phylogenetic diversity (SES.PD) and for mean pairwise distances (SES.MPD) within plant communities were significantly different from random expectations for recent woodlands, but did not differ from random expectations for ancient forests ( Fig. 1b ) . The NMDS separated the two forest categories as clearly as taxonomic composition, and much more clearly than functional composition (Fig. 3 ) . Additionally, the PERMANOVA showed significant differences in the phylogenetic composition of plant communities between the two Accepted Article forest categories (p = 0.001 ) . β-dispersion did not differ between recent woodlands and ancient forests (permutation-based test; p = 0.021 ) .
Discussion
We showed that herbaceous plant communities of recent and ancient forests harbored clearly distinct taxonomic and phylogenetic compositions whereas functional composition differed little. In addition, recent woodlands harbored more species, with different identities and different evolutionary histories. However, recent woodlands and ancient forests had very similar functional specialisation and originality, as well as very similar resilience capabilities.
Contrasting changes in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic compositions
Our results demonstrate that functional composition differs far less than taxonomic and phylogenetic composition between recent woodlands and ancient forests. A first interpretation could be related to the fact that phylogenetic diversity seems to be more sensitive to environmental changes than functional diversity: driven by macroevolutionary processes that shaped lifeorganisms based on their overall features, phylogenetic diversity may give us a more accurate proxy of niche dimensions than functional diversity, which is highly dependent on the life-history traits considered (Crisp and Cook, 2012; Prinzing et al., 2016 ) . The weak functional dissimilarities between recent and ancient forests also suggests strong functional redundancy within the pool of understorey forest plants. Species related to different clades may indeed share very similar functional features, such as Conopodium majus and Hyacinthoides non-scripta, two medium early-flowering geophytes belonging to the clades Apiales (dicots) and Asparagales (monocots ) , respectively (Appendix S1: Fig. S5 ) . In fact, shifts in functional composition, which are mainly characterized by a lower dissimilarity among plots of recent woodlands, seem to result more from the fact that recent woodlands lack the functional features observed in ancient forests than from the emergence of functionally different novel assemblages. Consequently, this result is consistent with the taxonomic and phylogenetic facet that also suggests a significant niche shift between the two forest categories.

Divergence in the plant communities of recent and ancient forests: a niche shift induced by a break in the temporal forest continuity?
Our results confirmed that recent woodlands, especially in western Europe where forests are highly fragmented, may harbor plant species and a life-history trait composition strongly different from ancient forests (Hermy and Verheyen, 2007; Kimberley et al., 2013; Kirby and Watkins, 2015 ) . More originally, our findings reinforce the emerging idea that a break in the temporal continuity may also impact the ecological niche and related evolutionary history of the overall understorey communities (Baeten et al., 2015 ) . A first interpretation of this compositional dichotomy may be related to dispersal limitation. Several ancient forest species absent or less frequent in recent woodlands (e.g. Vaccinum myrtillus; Appendix S1: Fig. S5) are indeed slowgrowing, poorly reproductive, and weak dispersers (Verheyen et al. 2003; Verheyen and Hermy, ; Baeten et al., 2015 ) . As a consequence, their colonization of regrowth forests can take several decades or centuries, so that recent woodlands may exhibit a “colonization credit” with respect to ancient forest species (Bergès et al., 2015; Naaf and Kolk, 2015 ) . Second, compositional variations between the two forest types may also result from disturbances of the soil biota by agricultural legacy, e.g. past fertilizations which may have increased mineral and organic nutrient concentrations, as we noted (Appendix S1: Table S2; Koerner et al., 1997 ) . These post-agricultural conditions may thus prevent typical forest species from establishing in recent woodlands because they tend not to tolerate nutrient-rich soils, their mutualists may be lacking, or they cannot always compete with other established plants (Hermy and Verheyen, 2007 ) . Several species indeed, mainly oligotrophic and acidophilic ones, known to be specialists of ancient forests (see Hermy et al., 1999 ) , were only recorded or more frequently found in ancient forests, e.g. Hypericum pulchrum, Millium effusum, Oxalis acetosella (Appendix S1: Fig. S5 ) . In addition, agricultural legacy may also explain the higher species richness and the recruitment of novel species such as Geum urbanum or Crataegus monogyna in recent woodlands (Appendix S1: Fig. S5 ) . Such patterns remain rare in the literature but have been highlighted in regions with acidic, nutrientpoor soils and species-poor communities (Hermy and Verheyen, 2007 ) . In these environments, such as the Armorican massif, past soil fertilizations may have indeed reduced nutrient limitations and thus facilitated the colonization of recent woodlands by a wider range of species than in ancient forests (Koerner et al., 1997; Graae, 2000 ) .
However, we can note that it is tricky to disentangle the respective influences of past landuse legacies from those of potential pre-existing abiotic conditions: past deforestations were Accepted Article mainly carried out on nutrient-rich soils, so that the remaining ancient forests are often established on nutrient-poorer soils (Bergès et al., 2015 ) . This could explain – at least partly – why some ancient plant species were absent from recent woodlands as well as why some recent plant species were absent from ancient forests. Nevertheless, the differences between both forest categories were noted while the variations in geological substrates were incorporated into the analyses, thus suggesting that the pre-existing conditions influenced marginally the biodiversity changes.
Higher functional diversity and evolutionary history in recent woodlands might be due to lower niche-based filtering Our results tend to support the hypothesis that past land uses, at least in regions with acidic and nutrient-poor soils, may lead an enlargement of the niche occupied by the understorey plant communities. Higher functional richness and phylogenetic α-diversity indeed suggest that plant communities filled a greater niche volume in recent woodlands than in ancient forests (Fig. 1a ) . This pattern is consistent across the three facets of biodiversity studied: we noted that functional and phylogenetic diversity were closely correlated with species richness (r²=0.75, 0.96; p < 0.001; respectively ) . According to Cadotte and Tucker (2018 ) , such strong congruences with species richness are quite unusual and seem to be a particularity of balanced phylogenetic trees (with few isolated clades with singular trait combinations; see Appendix S1: Fig. S5 ) . Thus, as each clade being represented by several species, the environmental selection of many clades (such as in the recent woodlands) necessarily leads to an increase in both species and phylogenetic richness. However, even in such specific contexts, these gains in biological diversity are not simply related to the effect size: compared to ancient forests, recent woodlands shown higher values of functional richness even after controlling for the effect size with null models (Fig. 1b ) . Moreover, this assumption of a weaker niche-based filtering in the recent woodlands is also corroborated by the lack of clustered patterns for both metrics (Fig. 1b ) : that suggests that habitat filtering little affected the functional and phylogenetic richness of these plant communities. In addition, our results illustrate that ancient forests harbor plant communities functionally and phylogenetically more divergent than those of recent woodlands (Fig. 1a-b ) . Such patterns are generally interpreted as a sign of strong biotic filtering, although the causes underlying overdispersion are still debated ( Cadotte and Tucker, 2017 ) . Given that ancient forest plant communities have been assembled for much longer than those of recent woodlands, it is indeed highly probable that biotic interactions were much more structuring. Thus, our results on functional and phylogenetic α-diversity Accepted Article converge on the interpretation that past land uses seem to lead to shifts in assembly processes which in turn contribute to accentuate the differences between recent and ancient forests.
Beyond singularities: convergence of conservation importance and resilience capabilities between recent and ancient forests
Surprisingly, recent woodlands harbored understorey communities as functionally specialized, original, redundant, and potentially robust to disturbances as those of ancient forests. We expected recent woodlands to harbor degraded and more vulnerable communities, i.e. less specialized, distinct, and resilient species (Ghazoul et al., 2015; Kirby and Watkins, 2015 ) , notably because of the lack of specialist ancient forest species. Several causes may explain these results. First, this relative rapid recovery (in about a century) of community structures may have been favored by an initially weakly fragmented landscape. Hedgerow networks were indeed still dense in the region in the early 20th century, when the development of the studied recent woodlands began. These hedges may have conserved typical forest species such as Polygonatum multiflorum and made it easier for them to colonize recent woodlands (Appendix S1: Fig. S5; Gloaguen et al., ). Second, the functional convergence between ancient forests and recent woodlands might also be viewed as the effect of the degradation of ancient forests, rather than only as the ability of recent woodlands to rapidly recover highly resilient, original and specialized plant communities. Forest management of ancient forests may have indeed had a strong impact on biodiversity and functions, and potentially contributed to reduce functional differences between recent woodlands and ancient forests (Hermy and Verheyen, 2007; Kirby and Watkins, 2015 ) . Third, another potential explanation could be that plant species characteristic of earlier successional stages remain in recent woodlands (plants of forested stages nevertheless, given the functional similarity between the two categories ) . These species may introduce functional features that compensate for the lack of those of the typical forest species; for example, Crateagus monogyna was much more present in recent woodlands and had a similar high degree of functional specialisation to Taxus baccata, another shrub-tree only found in ancient forests (Appendix S1: Fig. S5 ) . However, species composition differences can persist over time (Baeten et al., 2010 ) , so we assume that the functional convergence between recent and ancient forests is not a mere temporary oddity. Overall, the present study shows that recent woodlands can spontaneously recover the high functional resilience and conservation importance of ancient forests although they harbor plant communities with clearly distinct taxonomic and phylogenetic compositions.

Passive rewilding as a tool for conserving and restoring forest biodiversity
Our results provide evidence that spontaneous recent woodlands may play a significant role in conserving original, resilient, and highly diverse forest plant communities. We confirmed that ancient forests are important for the conservation of assemblages inherited from the pre-industrial period (Hermy and Verheyen, 2007; Bergès et al., 2015; Kirby and Watkins, 2015 ) , especially because of the specificity of their species and lineage composition. But we also showed that recent woodlands, by harboring a greater evolutionary history, may act as forest-biodiversity reservoirs and thus help to conserve the regional eco-evolutionary potential (Winter et al., 2013 ) . Moreover, recent woodlands potentially cover a diversity and a complexity of ecosystem properties comparable to those of ancient forests, since the degrees of originality and specialisation are maintained. And this is true even if the nature of these properties may vary slightly due to slight changes in functional composition. More particularly, in the current climate change perspective, such capacities to respond to disturbances expected to intensify over time (e.g. hydric stress) appear crucial for the conservation of forest biodiversity and related ecological services. For these reasons, we argue that farmland abandonment can be very favorable for biodiversity, at least in some biogeographical and ecological contexts (see also the review by Queiroz et al., 2014 ) . Obviously, all species will not benefit of passive rewilding ; there will be both winners and losers ( Carver 2019 in Pettorelli et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that farmland abandonment is not systematically synonymous of ecological impoverishment, especially when biodiversity is studied through several distinct components and not only according to species richness and patrimonial value. So, recent researches shown that ecosystem de-domestication may benefit for several taxa, such as birds (Hanioka et al., 2018 ) , ground-beetles (Yamanaka et al., ), moths (Mirauda et al., 2019) or spiders (Morel et al., 2019) and thus enrich ecological communities at both local and landscape scales. Nevertheless, further research is still needed, notably to confirm our results in other contexts ( e.g. after decades of intensive agricultural exploitation) and/or with a broader sampling, especially of recent woodlands. Indeed, as large and contiguous post-agricultural forests are rare in fragmented landscapes (especially in Brittany ) , it is difficult to balance sampling design enough to draw up an inventory representative of all situations. Our results, based on parametric statistical models and showing homogeneous variances for almost all the metrics assessed (see Appendix S1: Table S4 ) , seem robust enough to consider that the recent woodlands studied here have significant Accepted Article resilience capacities. However, there is a non-zero probability that, in other contexts, recent woodlands do not spontaneously, and as quickly, recover biodiversity features similar to those of relictual ancient forests. Overall and despite these uncertainties, as passive rewilding is the cheapest restoration method, we suggest that it should be a very useful tool for nature conservation, either to restore regional forest plant biodiversity when forest areas are restricted and fragmented or, at least, to recover an original nature aesthetic, little influenced by human, and which has become very rare in western Europe.
